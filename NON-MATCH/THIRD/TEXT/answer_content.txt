612,father diabetic sounds like you are too see your doc and aggressively fix these multiple problems asap
613,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs/carries things too big to go into the arteries/veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph for anything bad like bacteria/viruses/cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well
614,need information those are symptoms that need to be addressed there just isnt enough information i would want lab tests  such as thyroid  and sugar testing stomach tests such as upper gi and gallbladder test  your physical exam should also reveal more pcos would lend itself to endocrine problems  such as sugar and thyroid  weight gain  hair growth and is very common  1 in 20 women

729,conduction heart dr might be benign  but if it is causing irrregular or rapid heart beats  check with the cardiologist that deals with conduction problems
730,check your ribs if you have a rib out  you could have the pain you describe seek out a do (osteopathic physician) or a chiropractic physician to evaluate your ribs to see if that is the source also  your stomach and your esophagus are in that area i didnt see that you had an egd reflux  and gastric or esophageal ulcers could cause the pain
731,yes yes  it is an option for a brain tumor discuss further with your doctor if this is something available/feasible to be done in your case
732,need radiation tx as a patient you have the right to refuse any therapy as long as you are aware of the consequencies of your decision now  radiation therapy will be needed if you only had a lumpectomy- to reduce your recurrence risk to the same breast that is for your own benefit you are young which means your risk for cancer recurrence will be quite significant- so you want to reduce it as much as possible
733,you may or may not some breast anormalities on mammogram can remain and be seen on future mammograms if they remain stable there is less concern over them some abnormal findings may subside every mammogram should be compared to previous ones to assess any new changes or its stability please also remember that about 10% of breast cancers may not be detected by mammogram a clinical exam is also needed since some breast abnormalities can be detected by your physician and not the mammogram
734,need more info you gave predicted value but what was your actual value by definition  asthma is reversable airway disease  ie once you treat it  your lungs return to baseline normal in contrast  copd  your airways will not return to normal but rather reach a lower than normal baseline depending on how severe you are thre are four leverl of disease and you get catagorized based on a lung function test
735,pediatrician? good evening  eczema is a very common condition; many pediatricians are familial with its management ask your pediatrician if you need to see a specialist; he or she will know whether the condition in your child is related to allergies  as is the case often if so a visit with an allergist (who are very familiar eczema) will address the cause of exacerbation knowing what makes it worse helps
736,not usually most dental infections have dental pain  painful swelling  fever so unlikely i would be concerned about something going on in the parotid salivary gland which is in the same location you're describing see ent
737,get evaluated asap for viral infection  dehydration  gastritis  food poisoning etc take care!
738,the question is what your daughter has and not what it could be if it were possible  does that mean that is what she has? no based upon whether or not she has other symptoms  i would suggest that you have her seen by a pediatrician or pcp or a dentist or both hope she feels better
739,mammo vs sono mammography is still the screening standard of care for dense breasts the sensitivity of mammography for detecting cancer(80% across the board) decreases in dense breasts  some studies show to 50% or lower there is some data to suggest sonography performs better than mammo in dense breasts many are now performing both screening mammo and sono in dense breasts  it is an evolving situation
740,does she hav asthma? if she has history of asthma or allergies? if not she need formal chest x-ray and pulmonary function test some times it can be granulomatous condition if it is asthma or allergies she need antihistamines or inhaled steroid on daily basis to prevent recurrence of flares i hope this helps please let me know if you have any other questions
741,yes the final reading would be done by radiologist  ct of chesst not only detect pulmonary embolism  but tumors  infection  rib fractures  excess fluid in lungs and areas of decreased ventilation
742,blow job it is highly unlikely to achieve pregnancy through the mechanism that you are describing a woman ovulates on 'length of cycle - 14 days'  eg  in a 28 day cycle on day 14  in a 30 day cycle on day 16 this  too  makes it unlikely that she could get pregnant from this encounter
743,antibiotic diarrhea this is antibiotic related diarrhea due to the antibiotic effecting your intestinal bacteria usually gets better after antibiotic stops could try taking probiotics with it
744,both vein diseases similarities: both conditions are defective & enlarged veins which are often painful both can form clots in them both are very common both are genetically inherited both typically worsen with pregnancy the main difference in these conditions is the location: hemorrhoids involve the anus & varicose veins are mainly on the legs the pathophysiology & aggravating factors also differ
745,and? what is your question? do you think we can diagnose the problem over the internet? sorry  but we can't you will need to see a local dentist it sounds like you may have an infection  gum or tooth related
746,nocturnal nocturnal ( nighttime) numbness and tingling and pain in the hand can be associated with carpal tunnel syndrome while diabetes can give peripheral neuropathy typically the tingling associated with diabetic neuropathy will affect both hands equally as well as the feet however with diabetes or any other systemic problem that can affect nerves and circulation  the presence of the underlying disorder can worsen the symptoms of carpal tunnel when it gets worse this also means that diabetes sometimes prevents the pain form occurring early on and when it does occur may feel worse suddenly nonetheless the reason carpal tunnel seems to be worse at night when sleeping is several fold 1  the pressure on the nerve is increased by the increased tissue pressure form lying down  the fluid that sits outside the cells redistributes itself to the face and upper extremity when someone lies down ( its why feet are swollen at the end of the day and the face feels puffy and fingers stiff in the am) this extra fluid increases the pressure on the nerve a second thing that often occurs when one sleeps unsplnted is that the wrists flexed or extended  also putting more pressure on the nerve the pressure builds  the fingers go numb  pain follows and finally the pain build enough to awaken the sufferer to start  a simple wrist splint may suffice to help with the night time symptoms not too tight as that can cause pressure on the nerve too defeating the purpose next antiinflammatories  otc non steroidal antiinflammatories but if someone is a diabetic taking other medications then they should always check with their pcp/family doctor/internist or endocrinologist before taking nsaid' s as the y can have a deleterious effect upon renal ( kidney) function a pcp may prescribe antiinflammatories as well injections of corticosteroids are often used acutely by hand surgeons for non operative care a nerve conduction study and emg can help define/delineate the role of carpal tunnel v  neuropathy start with a pcp and consider seeing a hand surgeon once the work up is initiated  
747,features associated with benefit of antibiotics are fever  nodes  tender nodes  gunk in the back of the throat (even by itself a strong indicator)  coughing up discolored phlegm (even by itself a reason)  lung inflammation (like wheeze  breathing issues) which has to be addressed
748,ms on mri not always ms lesions (abnormalities) come and go over time sometimes lesions are in the brain  and not the spinal cord if  however  your doctor has localized your pain/neurologic symptoms to a certain segment of the spine  it would be a good sign if your mri is negative in that region
749,proper advice- the best answer to your question would be by a dentist who knows your complete medical and dental history and has already seen you please don't look for answers on the internet we could only guess as to what you require and why
750,yes stress is the great imitator can easily cause all of the symptoms you ask about if you had these symptoms and had a negative workup then you are lucky check with your primary care physician for ways to help manage your stress best wishes
751,polypharmacy alert! you need to check the spelling of medications you use; learn both the trade name and the generic versions a pharmacy dispensed clomiphene to my patient instead of what was prescribed  clomipramine  it went undetected for three months her ovaries were 3x normal size  hormones were off the chart and she thought she was going insane! remember kiss? serotonin syndrome is a serious risk! google it!
752,mouth breathing odors causing bad breath come from the stomach  lungs or sinuses your bad breath is the result of clogged nasal passages post nasal drip is another symptom of your nasal-sinus disease it may be a sinus infection  nasal polyps  or allergic or nonallergic rhinitis when your nose is blocked you breathe through your mouth dry mouth and odor is the result restore nasal breathing & odor resolves
753,lymph nodes they could be from a number of causes i would check with your dentist to make sure it is not coming from your teeth
754,dry eye? also  with lupus  you are at risk for severe dry eyes that can potentially lead to all your symptoms you can do an easy test try otc preservative-free artificial tears  1 drop every hour and see if your symptoms improve at all either way  because your risk for dry eyes is so great  you should probably see an eye md as well
755,allergy consult the issue is complex and you should consult an allergist do realize that even though we can usually control the rash  not uncommonly no cause can be found despite exhaustive studies in the meanwhile  try taking antihistamine 3 to 4 times a day to see if this may help the dose needed for itchy skin is much higher than what is needed to control hay fever but even then it may not work
756,not likely but 'yes' if there was any fluid released by the male (pre-cum))  it can contain sperm - not as much as an ejaculation  but enough also  very healthysperm even near the vaginal opening can swim into the canal and if the timing is just right  conception can occur
757,most mammograms are the gold standard for breast cancer screening  but they are not 100% in addition to yearly mammograms  you should be having a clinical breast exam performed by a physician
758,be be patient and wait for the reading from the radiologist don't make your own diagnosis
759,certainly if your hemoglobin was 10  then you have an anemia  diseases that cause anemia  including vitamin deficiency (b12) can cause fatigue  depression  anxiety you need a careful examination to find out what is the problem  including checks for cancer  inflammatory diseases  vitamin deficiencies  ulcers  other bleeding states  etc  particularly with the postural tachycardia schedule it this week!
760,possibly you should see your md to get a blood test to see if you are pregnant not having a period for 2 months depending on your age is generally not normal and your symptoms could be constant with pregnancy
761,yes hpv causes most of the cervical cancer but it only causes squamous cell cancer other types of cervical cancer (adenocarcinoma  etc) are rare but not caused by hpv
762,oral medicine see an oral medicine specialist for assistance in managing all aspects of your condition they are the specialists for just this type of problem good luck
763,it is possible&gt; mid cycle bleeding is associated with ovulation if you are sexually active without contraception then a pregnancy test is in order if you are using contraception then pregnancy is less likely
764,not sure it does not sound like a panic attack  as you say there is muscle twitching which isn't any of the panic attack criteria i would say it could be some sort of physical problem and should be addressed by a physician for further evaluation good luck
765,ok this reading is ok  but maybe e a bit low depending upon why you are taking the meds should bring this up with doc especially if you get light headed when you stand quickly or when you take a hot shower
766,probably not sorry to hear that your depression is not under the best control however  antidepressants like zoloft do not work like painkillers as in taking an extra dose 1 day will help that day (if you notice any improvement that day  it is probably the placebo effect) it's not wise to keep varying your dose of zoloft from day to day or to take 400 mg talk to your doc about rx resistant depression
767,lid hygiene a stye is a blocked oil gland of the eyelid much like a clogged pore or pimple use warm compresses (warm cloth x 5-10 min over eyelids 4-6 x/day) to open glands ; clean eyelid margin with baby shampoo to unclog the gland styes rarely get infected  you may not need the antibiotic  however a steroid ointment (maxitrol) may help keep up lid hygiene morning ; night to prevent others from forming
768,need for evaluation it is not feasible to provide a meaningful opinion without taking more history  physical examination and some tests it would be prudent for you to consult your doctor as soon as you can
769,no salmonella can be resistance to amoxycillin also all salmonella does not need to treat
770,remain deep infect my experience: there is less pain after an extraction and a bone graft then just an extraction there could be incomplete removal of the tooth infection and now with the bone graft on top of it  the infection would be difficult to access likewise you may have more than one tooth giving you discomfort that still needs care if an antibiotic doesn't help and no other issues  redo the graft!
771,yes check a pregnancy test as the brown spotting could be from implantation
772,not yet dense breasts often decrease the effectiveness of mammogram if there is any concern about the mammogram you could consider asking for an mri to be performed of the breasts- this may add additional information in helping to determine if there is anything to be concerned about
773,possible could be the very beginnings of a stye usually when caught early when it just inflammation  a chronic stye requiring surgery can be prevented see your eye md
774,it may be too early in addition to above answer  there are other factors infection go through stages first  the toxins released by the bacteria and dead tissue cause inflammation which is associated with tissue swelling and pain there is nothing to drain then as more white blood cells migrate to the infection some will die along with your tissue causing cavitation filled with pus  & that is the time to drain it
775,repeat gallbladder attacks are a possibility liver cysts are very common and a 1 cm one would be asymptomatic and of no consequence why was mri performed? what about other testing? a consultation with a gastroenterologist would be indicated given length of symptoms a study to evaluate the function of the gallbladder called a hida scan with ejection fraction may be helpful
776,thanks for asking! the fatigue could be caused by numerous things one of the most likely causes is if you are narcotics and have been for an extended period of time chronic opioid usage can lead to low testosterone and other hormonal/chemical imbalances  which lead to fatigue  low sex drive  etc another issue is chronic pain can cause hormonal imbalance i would start by checking your testosterone level
777,reasonable this is a reasonable option if you respond well with a scs trial good luck
778,need more eval may be liver  gallbladder  rib  kidney  pancreas problem an enlarged liver may be from fatty changes a ct may show fatty liver better a hida scan may show gallbladder problems other labs needed check with your dr
779,pupp rash sounds like the rash of pregnancy many women get an itchy red rash for no known reason your ob can make recommendations such as epsom baths and even benadryl
780,agree -- very low one of ten women have fibroadenomas -- benign growths of milk-making tissue of the breast they are never cancerous  and if a woman makes one  she can make more they can shrink very late in life  but tend to grow or stay stable until menopause if they have not been re-examined or re-scanned with ultrasound in two years  your daughter should see a breast surgeon to check them again good luck
781,debatable coq10 ha sbeen claime dto benefit the heart but even that is not scientifically proven it has no benefit to help control the cancer so i would not waste money giving coq10 to your mother
782,take your abx usually for gonorrhea and chlamydia  patients are given rocephin as a one time shot and either zithromax or doxycycline metronidazole is usually given for bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis you will need to finish the entire course of the antibiotics (usually 10-14 days) sometimes it may take a week before your symptoms improve for more info see wwwcdcgov/std/defaulthtm
783,get tested your blisters may be caused by ingrown hairs  razor burn  friction or other trauma just for your reassurance  however  you should get tested for herpes by your doctor
784,probably not if your baby has nasal symptoms without cough or fever  it's more likely to be a common cold rather than influenza saline nose drops and nasal suction (as often as needed) can help keep your baby more comfortable if other symptoms develop or if there is no improvement after a few days  time to see the dr
785,more info needed did you get a head ct or mri when you were in the hospital? if these symptoms are new or if they are getting worse compared to when you were in the hospital  yes go back if any of the following: headache is constant  associated with nausea  vomiting  gets worse when you bend down  strain  cough or sneeze  go to the er immediately if you are not sure  err on the safe side and go back for checkup
786,positive test pregnancy hormone rises during the first several weeks of pregnancy  peaking around 10 weeks at 100  000  give or take so  all this test presently shows is that you are pregnant from the level alone  you cannot say anything regarding gestational age
787,more info needed how long has the mass been there  and for how long have you been loosing weight and have had no appetite? unfortunately  these types of problems need to be physically examined  together with a full med hx  possible blood work and ct scans trying to guess a diagnosis over the internet is not prudent call your physician for an appointment
788,possible however  several other conditions could cause your findings  and need to consider such problems as vasculitis  arteritis  lupus  sarcoidosis  lyme disease  hiv  syphilis in end  this may indeed be ms  and you need treatment for whatever is causing your problems
789,common white cells are the body's fighting cells if you have an infection  common to see white cells wbcs
790,maybe wisdom teeth it may be due to your wisdom teeth if you have them if not  have an ent evaluate you
791,yes current guidelines recommend the use of statins for diabetics with a ldl of greater than 100 an optional goal of decreasing the ldl to less than 70 is usually set for those at particularly high risk
792,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs/carries things too big to go into the arteries/veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph for anything bad like bacteria/viruses/cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well
793,hpv in theory the more contact with hpv the more chance for transmission and vice versa i would see your doctor for more info and for now protected sex via condom
794,pregnant high you had exposure to semen when your egg was most ready
795,functional medicine you may have success working with a functional medicine doctor who can help you find your root causes for having fibromyalgia and arthritis i personally treat a lot of fibromyalgia patients  and many have issues with gluten  other food reactions  genetic snps like the mthfr snp  nutritional deficiencies  hormonal imbalances  heavy metal toxicity  and lifestyle issues that can be fixed goodluck
796,is it open you need to see wound care doctor rather than nurse is the bone intact ? still broken? bone might be infected or you might have gout or something else altogether
797,probably not it is more likely that your child came down with another infection  commonly viral one if amoxicillin did not work  ear pain and fever should have persisted
798,see your doctor it sounds like you have an infection in the area and need to be on medication there is no home or over the counter treatment for this you need to see your doctor or urgent care for a proper diagnosis and treatment
799,thyroid nodules with elevated thyroglobulin of 70 is significant  but without thyroglobulin antibody screen does not mean much fine needle biopsy is indicated
800,i think you are over simplifying matter serotonin is not the only neurotransmitter involved in depression not all antidepressants effect serotonin levels haven't seen studies indicating that antidepressants are over-prescribed were there specific studies you reviewed in reaching this conclusion? if you actually review studies which led to black box warning  you will see that there were numerous factors
801,too numerous to name this can be so many things that it warrants a work up by a doc in the mean time  take otc prilosec to help make sure it's not acid reflux
802,no any unusual  outside force will influence your child's facial development facial growth in the presence of a sucking habit can lead to narrow upper jaw with crossbites and a long lower face the airway is also affected and will not develop properly  these kids generally breath through their mouth thumb  pacifier sucking is mostly for momwork out a plan to remove the sucking habit asap
803,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs/carries things too big to go into the arteries/veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph for anything bad like bacteria/viruses/cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well
804,are are you feeling slowly better or worse? if better sit tight and things will improve if worse then further action by your surgeon might be needed
805,prodrome certainly serious symptoms you may be in the earliest stages of shingles; however  see your physician for a complete exam and ct of head and neck for starters 
806,in another question you mention you suffered an injury of a fellow cheerleader landing on your foot - not sure why you keep repeating the same question you injured it  now go see a doctor to take care of it
807,see below brain lesions that can be seen on mri that are similiar to ms can be seen with a clotting disorder known as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome if you a history of miscarriages or blood clots  you want to be to checked for this and if you have it you must quit smoking as it will elevate your risk for clots and strokes
808,no that will not happen
809,yes yes but try to keep the saline as clean a possible
810,ketoconazole shampoo get a prescription for 2% nizoral shampoo and leave in for 5 minutes daily until improved 
811,sinusitis likely sinusitis see md for exam/xray/probable antibiotics
812,possibly i would recommend discussing this in detail with your medical oncologist being a stage one it is unlikely that chemo will be required as long as the tumor has been adequately removed surgically stage one breast cancer is a potentially very curable stage with the proper treatment
813,neuro eval looks like you need a good neuro consult you may need a spinal mri and/ or an emg/ncs  though this should be coordinated through a specialists office after a complete review of you symptoms  examination  and testing to date i hope you get some answers soon
814,rotator cuff injury? you should get an mri
815,polyclonal gammopath polyclonal gammopathy is not the same as monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (mgus) or associated disorders such as myeloma  lymphoma  or leukemia poly=many clones is normal having an increase in immunoglobulins (ig's  antibodies) can be associated with autoimmune disorders  hiv  hepatitis  etc there may be some other reason to see a hematologist  but not b/c of polyclonal ig's
816,we need 7-8 hours of sleep  so 5 hours is not enough please enter a anxiety /panic attack program   as this can be a debilitating problem affecting your life and the life of those around you start exercising too and remember nobody died from panic attacks! chose a good shrink and psychiatrist
817,depends an oral device for sleep apnea can be very effective  but the cpap is still the gold standard of care but there are many types of dental sleep mouthpieces and there is no one mouthpiece that works for every patient i would not consider buying one online or at a retail store improper fit can create tmj/tmd  move teeth and create many problems see a dental specialist  but also consult with
818,get it checked it would be wise to have the tooth looked at critically to determine why the crown came off if it was due to a deficiency in the structure of the underlying tooth  this will need to be corrected or the problem could keep recurring if it was a material failure  the chances of success are higher
819,no no  it is a benign tumor
820,pain you should get it checked out sometime there is stone which could be retained in cbd to cause dilation and pain
821,sure the left side may be draining but the right side might be harboring something under the tissue get in to see the oral surgeon asap for evaluation of all the areas you do not want to wait   especially when the lymph nodes are now involved explain the situation -- pain and swelling of node-- to get in asap good luck
822,see doctor with a fever gong on 3 days and her other symptoms take her to the doctor also keep her hydrated
823,wisdom teeth usually wisdom teeth can be extracted in an oral surgery office under iv sedation with little or no discomfort your oral surgeon should be consulted to evaluate your medical health and discuss all issues associated with your specific case good luck
824,headache normal mri does not rule out all the causes for the headache you may have headache from vascular problem  allergies  cluster headaches  etc you can get relief with medication consider getting a consultation with neurologist
825,thyroid thyroid nodules are somewhat common they are more common in older patients and females the vast majority of thyroid nodules are benign that means they have no significance and can be ignored however  imaging cannot reliably differentiate benign nodules from cancer the decision to biopsy should be made between you and your physician thyroid biopsy is safe and relatively easy for the patient who will usually have a small sore bruise after the procedure in my practice  i have to do about 20 biopsies to find one cancer i hope this helps
826,see md 4 evaluation you should really see your surgeon or physician for an evaluation  pain and swelling to the lymph nodes suggests an inflammatory or neoplastic or infectious process that should be evaluated with possible diagnostic imaging and/or surgery for removal or biopsy
827,variable effects the level of blood pressure required to cause headache or visual changes is very variable a lot of it depends on how high the blood pressure is chronically and how rapidly it rises above that level an important thing to realize is that your blood pressure could be quite high even if you don't have a headache or any visual changes
828,see ortho see an orthopedic surgeon who could do an ulnar decompression
829,variable it can be temporary or permanent you should make your doctor aware of it at your follow up appointment/
830,a few options first  if the scar is red or swollen  use an over-the-counter cortisone cream to calm the skin you can also do laser therapy or filler therapy  within one to three sessions  laser skin resurfacing using fractionated laser technology can even out the skin surface and increase new collagen formation to help fill in acne scars wear plenty of sunscreen  sun makes the scars worse hope this helped :]
831,see a doctor this can easily be diagnosed and treated by your local primary care physician  while making sure there is nothing more serious going on you should be better very soon
832,no alcohol can lead to cirrhosis but alcohol related cirrhosis does not always lead to cancer
833,breast feeding she could be sucking hard for milk or just because she is older and can most of her nutrients are from solid food now so your milk production may be less now you could try pumping to see if you have much now
834,needs evaluation 1 in 9 american women get breast cancer i would recommend a breast exam by your obgyn and a mammogram with a breast ultrasound if your breasts are dense it is good the heart is cleared it is most likely fibrocystic breasts which cause pain and is worsened by caffeine i like you thinking to always rule out the worst possibility
835,psychologic help this is a problem mostly in young women called trichotillomania hairs anywhere can be targets but for some reason the eyebrows and eyelashes are the most common - probably because they are so available this is something for behavior therapy - you probably would benefit from referral to such a counselor it is not a medical issue and does not respond to medication or surgery
836,possible i also trust your new statin hasn't given your skeletal muscle inflammation  which can also raise transaminases your physician knows how to continue the workup
837,serious spreading cellulitis is very serious and you must be seen in the hospital as soon as possible to get started on intravenous antibiotics
838,magnesium if orthototics do not help  tendonitis may respond to prolotherapy cramps can be due to electrolyte imbalance consider magnesium and potassium supplementation  and drink lots of water between meals check my website for details on magnesium supplementation webpage: drfairchildorg
839,tonsil i understand your fear but something is making your tonsil big and you are smart enough to not want to live with that
840,yes it's possible please check with your doctor and get tested to see if you are pregnant although early period could be a sign of miscarriage
841,chiro i would see a chiropractor for several months of jaw treatments possibly a physical therapist or even speech therapist may be able to help have you seen a maxillofacial surgeon? there may be a corrective surgical option
842,not likely by itself if the botox helps you get comfortable and the underlying cause of the muscle spasms can be addressed  a long term solution may be achievable otherwise  the botox will likely need to be re-administered
843,not enough info unfortunately  there is not enough information to answer your question what kind of composite filling was used  what placement technique (direct vs indirect)  what kind of bonding method was used  was a liner placed before the fillings were placed i have not encountered a problem like yours in over twenty years i'd seek out a second opinion!
844,fracture of tooth by not filling a cavity  the cavity will get larger and the tooth becomes weaker at some point  the cavity will reach the nerve which will cause more pain and possibly an infection  or the cavity will get large enough that the tooth fractures if the fracture occurs along the root of the tooth then the tooth may need to be removed
845,return to dds you seem to still have an infection you may need to have the swelling treated locally (drained) and you may need a different antibiotic if the first one used didn't clearup your infection meanwhile use ice on the swelling 20 min on/off
846,second opinion i would first get a second opinion then  i might make an appointment with a specialist in physical medicine some possible additional rehab i guess it depends how much your condition impairs you and what you want to do i also would want the surgeon to give me some idea about the success rate for the operation
847,yes this show low vitamin d  needs md evaluation whoo can determine the dose of vitamin d supplementan online consult with healthtap would be helpfull
848,one medrol pack however conventional wisdom is that if you haven't gotten enough relief with one medrol dose pack  unlikely its better to give more in fact new research is showing that your risk of fracture increases almost 400% after one oral dosepack of steroids you are better off getting an epidural steroid injection instead risk still exists but way less compared to oral steroids
849,yes in child and adolescent psychiatry it is common practice to use the alpha agonists like clonidine or guanfacine to reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity they can also be used to promote sleep if insomnia is severe the extended release version of clonidine is kapvay and the extended release version of guanfacine is intuniv talk with your prescribing physician if you have concerns! stay safe!
850,keep looking you symptoms are complex and many keep working with your doctors to find a cause there may be multiple reasons for your symptoms
851,vaginitis vaginitis (yeast infection) is the most common gynecologic diagnosis in primary care treatment in non-pregnant women who have symptoms is with metronidazole getting a rx is important as yeast infections make you more susceptible to contracting stds - chlamydia  gonorrhea  etc vaginal clindamycin cream is another treatment over the counter creams may help if you're certain its yeast infection
852,no dvt filters are not for everybody generally not needed nowadays removable filters are recommended and put in  if conditions where anticogulation can not be immediately performed due to bleeding or other causes tpa is not needed in all cases either
853,no urine pregnancy tests are very sensitive these days you can repeat the test in one week to make sure
854,not enough informati not typical herpes if present more than 10 days  definitely not see a dermatologist or gyn if they bother you
855,no the high bite will usually result in pain before you would get muscle hypertrophy resulting in a more prominent 'cheek' appearance it is possible that you have transient swelling from the anesthesia needle placement possibly causing a temporary hematoma (swelling/bruise)this is more common in anesthesia for upper back tooth restorations get the bite corrected meantime use hot moist compresses
856,symptoms? i would suggest that the symptoms that led you to have the blood work done in the first place would be the reason why you would want to visit a doctor lab results are difficult to interpret without any other history or context your bili level is mildly elevated  but that doesn't tell me anything without history and the cause could be perfectly benign see your doctor
857,three three months is too short to get arthritis and well within the normal recovery period if you could move the finger well after the injury  chances are that everything's fine and you just need more time to be sure you need to be evaluated by a hand surgeon most people i meet that have a problem like yours are healing well  but the pain is making them protective  which actually slows their recovery recovery can be quite counterintuitive it helps to get the advice and reassurance of a hand surgeon
858,spots sounds like traumatic areas  many possible causes  how long they been there  
859,doubtful but i don't think they are linked  but if in doubt  i would get a second opinion
860,not migraine there are many causes of dizziness if there is a true spinning sensation it is called vertigo and usually is due to a disturbance of the vestibular part of the inner ear if it is more of a lightheadedness it's often due to anxiety or stress for a patient oriented discussion of this topic see: bitly/1yzi7rd at patientcouk website
861,common in the first 3 months following vaginal delivery urinary incontinence is very common but typically improves/resolves one study demonstrated approximately 40% of women had incontinence that persisted 12 years after delivery

926,post-op healing the situation that you describe sounds normal often  when wisdom teeth are removed  either those that were impacted or not  the surrounding gum tissues remain in place during the immediate healing phase in time  as the extraction socket heals  the inflammation will subside and the size  amount  position of the gum tissue will reduce  keep your mouth clean during healing to promote this
927,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs/carries things too big to go into the arteries/veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph for anything bad like bacteria/viruses/cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well

1440,keep hands clean repeated superficial staph infections in the diaper area that clear up and recur  may be due to a family member who is a carrier for staph  reinfecting the site most of us think about washing our hands after changing a diaper  but this area has delicate skin  and bacteria from an adult's nose or dirty hands may cause an infection think to wash your hands before a diaper
1441,may  usually not a regular ct scan of the abdomen  without bowel preparation is not an ideal way to detect colon cancer many lesions are likely to be masked by the fecal matter large lesions may be discernible 3d ct scan  after bowel preparation would be better to detect colon cancer endoscopy is the better way  as polyp can be removed and suspicious lesions biopsied
1442,it depends the american colloge of ob/gyns recommends women who retain their cervix after hysterectomy  or those who don't but have a history of severe pre-cancer of the cervix  should continue to have pap smears
1443,ct xray is a very blunt tool but cheap ct is very precise but expensive
1444,get it done! a birads-4 mammogram describes a finding consistent with possible cancer in the breast the lesion may be a suspicious cluster of microcalcifications which would not be necessarily seen as a mass on ultrasound it is important to have the area biopsied
1445,minimal risk your concern is understandable radiation exposure from a chest xray is minimal for an adult (higher dose than children) a chest xray dose is equivalent to 10 days of natural background radiation (yes there is radiation exposure around us all the time)
1446,no that will not happen
1447,plantar fasciitis i suggest an ultrasound which can be used to quickly make this diagnosis
1448,no pancreatic cancer pancreatic cancer is very rest in 25 year olds and usually causes pain in the upper abdominal and/or back   not in the llq with a negative workup  your pain is likely due to a benign cause such as irritable colon  constipation or even simple colonic gas it is probably nothing serious but should be checked out with a ct scan of the abdomen/pelvis if it persists
1449,go see your dr and get checked for intestinal inflammation ibs  polyps/tumor endocrine/thyroid disorder etc take care and god bless you! http://wwwmedicinenetcom/constipation/articlehtm

1451,while that's possibl lets wait for a thorough evaluation (which would include a brain mri and spinal cord mri to be completed) before we self diagnose ms i do appreciate that this is scary and un-nerving and that the workup takes time but i wish to provide you with reassurance that we should be able to come up with an effective treatment plan once the diagnosis is more clear
1452,could be related to your anemia it depends on how low your iron stores are hopefully they have performed a pelvic ultrasound to help diagose what is occuring you possibly will need iron infusions  depending on how low your iron levels are make sure to take your iron medication with orange juice to help the absorption good luck!
1453,don't wait it sounds like the tooth is abcessed  and there is what we call a periapical abcess at the apex of the tooth root if a root canal is done soon enough  the bone can usually fill in if you wait to long  you could lose enough bone that the tooth will have to be removed try to get in soon
1454,taste buds provided that these bumps are not a symptom of underlying disease  i e there is no pain  swelling  bleeding  burning sensation  or discomfort of any kind  they are taste buds the major test buds are in the posterior part of the tongue
1455,speech delay: at 1 year 2-5 words with meaning    2 years 2-3 word sentence  sometimes little delay is acceptable ur son had 4 ear infections  needs hearing screening (tympanometry  oae) at pediatrician's office  if available if fails  need formal hearing evaluation by audiologist depending on the result  ent referral or speech therapy is decided if recent recurrent ear infection  ent doc puts pe tubes
1456,possibly get your bite adjusted with a dentist that specializes in occlusion also a night guard may help if clicking remains untreated you may eventually have pain  so get it treated now

1458,see below you have bruised the nerve (in the wrist) or produced either a hematoma or fluid swelling of the fibers in the wrist through which the nerves to the hand pass (as in carpal tunnel syndrome) put some ice on it for 20 min/hour repeatedly if it starts to subside  you are home free take an analgesic  such as ibuprofen  as well if the symptoms persists  you will need to call an orthopedist
1459,secondary lymphedema the swelling is caused by secondary lymphedema if you see a lymphedema therapist who can do manual lymph drainage and complex decongestive therapy - a special wrapping of legs swelling will go away within a week
1460,liver bile is made continuously by liver gallbladder just astor's and cocentrate it for use when needed so bile no is secreted into the bowel directly from liver
1461,ms + rheum? it would be unusual  but not impossible  to be diagnosed with ms and lupus or sarcoidosis your biopsy tests should help normal blood work is a vote against lupus  but it is not proof the rash you have could be a form of skin lupus (discoid) even when blood tests are normal
1462,obtain an xray the next step would be to see your doctor to get an xray to further evaluate the cause of your great toe pain and to have your physician examine your foot
1463,gene snp analysis do a gene snp analysis will help you understand vo2max status - if you want listen to my lecture http://drbrown us i explained in detail what would be the benefit of this test
1464,sinus surgery balloon sinuplasty - minimally invasive technique  uses a small balloon inflated to widen blocked passages  generally has less bleeding and shorter recovery time endoscopic sinus surgery - uses a small camera to visually examined the sinuses tiny surgical instruments inserted to remove obstructive tissues  does not require any incision as the whole procedure is performed through the nostrils
1465,possibly you should go see your oncologist or surgeon
1466,ask your doc in general  i do not see a problem with that type of program but it is really best for someone with knee replacements to discuss the appropriate exercise program with the orthopedist who did the surgery not every surgery is the same and there may be some precautions that are applicable to the individual
1467,possible some women experience pain from time to time with ovulation this is called mittleschmerz some brown discharge is also possible if it is severe  see a doctor
1468,more workup you absolutely need to have a spirometry or pulmonary function tests if they confirm asthma that is not controlled  singulair is a good idea your doctor might also try spiriva or a drug called xolair i suggest seeing an allergy and asthma expert to help you
1469,see a breast doctor it is important not to panic  but to take action to get the answer it sounds like you need a biopsy (sample of the mass) in order to find out what this is contact your doctor for a referral to a breast specialist most biopsies will come back as noncancerous
1470,see below to find out if you're pregnant or not  try to do over-the counter pregnancy test for your peace of mind  you might want to contact either your primary care physician or obgyn some things just cannot be diagnosed and addressed over the internet :) good luck!

1473,no thought i'd never say this  but maybe a chiropractor can help
1474,torn ligaments it would be unusual for your femur to slide off your tibia unless you tore all the ligaments around your knee like in a knee dislocation if you just tore your acl then your knee can be unstable with subluxation of the bones sometimes the acl can avulse from the tibia with bone exercise and knee strengthening is good for a acl tear and consideration of surgery can be discussed with your doctor
1475,double double vision indicates that your two eyes are not alligned this can be secondary to the muscles that control your eye movements or to the nerves that control the muscles i recommend seeking a neuro-ophhthalmologist for a full workup
1476,panic i would go with panic  i am glad you have the insight to know it is panic attack you are young with low risk and negative work up
1477,could be but most likely it is the edge of the socket where the tooth was extracted let your dentist take a look and you will know for sure
1478,psoriasis could be either psoriasis or a fungal infection go see a dermatologist or a podiatrist so that a biopsy of the skin can be performed to find out exactly what it could i have also see scalded skin syndrome that appears as peeling itchy feet this is bacterial infection
1479,arthritic changes probable cause is morning stiffness in ankles/feet i don't know your age but that would be helpful walking or moving around especially in the morning should ease symptoms xrays would be helpful to assist in diagnosis
1480,it can lung transplant for cf is an important life prolonging therapy but it exchanges one set of problems for another after transplant  there is risk of rejection of the transplanted lungs by one's own immune system requiring use of strong meds that suppress your immune system which then increases your risk of serious infections there are many facets to this - talk to your cf dr to discuss pros/cons
1481,yes see your urologist for immediate management which may include a procedure to place a ureteral stent (tube helping to drain the kidney if blocking stone) all depends on labs (blood urine tests) and signs of infection this becomes emergent if you have severe pain  nausea  vomiting  fever (>1004 degrees f)  or if you are diabetic later treatment includes using camera and/or shock waves
1482,go to er for treatment
1483,simple treatments! if you only have dandruff sx   really priasis  you can get a good effect with neutratar shampoos and their knock-offs  on a zinc pyrythione 1% shampoo i have patients alternate every two days with great results ketoconazole shampoo works very well  but requires a prescription i wager that these will work well!
1484,no  not really medical use of x-rays causes minimal radiation exposure  so it is considered safe so you should not worry about cancer at the present level of ct scanning
1485,new infection you had viral infection it doesnt need antibiotic it runs it's course it can end up in bacterial infection then you need antibiotic your doctor saw evidence of bacterial infection in throat/sinus and gave you amoxi now you have bacterial infection in lungs amoxi doesnt work here if no fever and general sickness you can wait o/w you will need a different kind of antibiotic
1486,unlikely the internet is dangerous place at times it gives people all this information but can't help them interpret the significance or insignificance of it at your age cancer is way way down on the list of possibilities for your symptoms you probably just have a benign little lymph node but your anxiety has spiraled you into a whole list of other symptoms go to your doctor  and get your life back
1487,get it checked i suggest that you get it checked out although  this may be a minor thing  like patella tendinitis (inflammation of one of the tendons that hold the knee cap in place)  more serious causes may also occur you may be referred to physical therapy if your exam/xray are negative
1488,maybe embolism a consideration for that set of symptoms of fairly sudden onset would be for a pulmonary embolism a chest ct angiogram would diagnose this if normal  then could consider a echocardiogram to evaluate heart structure/function and estimation of pressure in the lung blood vessels
1489,2o or 3o hypothyroid it's always helpful to include reference range for test results so that they can be interpreted appropriately however  it appears that free t4 & t3 are at lower limit of normal while tsh is just shy of being suppressed because you're complaining of hypothyroidism  these labs are consistent w/2o (pituitary) or 3o (hypothalamic) hypothyroidism rather than 1o (thyroid) go see your endocrinologist
1490,as as antibiotic therapy is initiated  the area of infection becomes more localized and can often appear as though it is getting worse before it gets better it should be reevaluated by your dentist if you are having continued pain antibiotics alone may not completely take you out of pain
1491,seems likely you should get tested! this sure sounds like and std please refrain from any sexual activity until you are tested and treated if nessecery
1492,see your doctor your symptoms may be signs of something significantly wrong one cannot tell without a complete history  physical and possible lab/imaging tests follow with your doctor as soon as you can
1493,at this point if you are 3 days late and are sexually active  consider checking a home pregnancy test signs that you might have a yeast infection include: vaginal itching  pain  thick white cheesy vaginal discharge and sometimes burning with urination if you are having some or all of these symptoms  you should seek an evaluation  especially if you've never had a yeast infection previously
1494,see a doctor asap you should see a doctor asap you may be bleeding from your lower colon or rectum
1495,absolutely yes this is a common complaint patients say their hip hurts when they mean their groin or the lower buttock on that side in fact  that presenting symptom can delay the diagnosis of degenereative disc disease i suggest you be assessed by a pain specialist and a spine surgeon do not want to wait until you have lost motor function to have spine stabilzation epidural steroid injections help and pt
1496,sounds like you need to have endoscopic dilatation or surgical pyloroplasty consult with an interventional gastroenterologist who can recommend which procedure is better for you
1497,vague the question was pretty vague  not clearly stated  and in my opinion  didn't show enough information could you please paraphrase or interpret that sentence for me?
1498,most likely anxiety it was most likely anxiety but you might want to get a check up for possible heart poblems
1499,maybe migraine  more with a history of migraine  this could be one of those  but likely you know your migraine pattern so if this seems different than your usual migraine  you should be right away  especially with your other medical problems it could be from blood pressure  or even a serious issue like a bleed
1500,no due to skin cancer risks of tanning beds  i am in agreement with ben ferguson who states that there is no exposure to tanning beds that is safe or harmless  chemo or no chemo

1502,pelvic relaxation vaginal delivery results in damage to the pelvic support that allows the bladder  urethra  uterus  rectum  and vagina to begin to drop in the pelvis some women end up with the pelvic organs dropping out through the opening of the vagina some of them will require surgery to repair the damage and decrease the symptoms
1503,i i think it is important for you to see your doctor as soon as possible with the history you have given  it is possible that you have temporal arteritis this is a potentially serious inflammation of blood vessels in the head and face region another possibility is that you are experiencing the warning signs of an outbreak of varicella zoster otherwise known as shingles a shingles outbreak in the face is also a serious problem and must be treated promptly
1504,baseline age 35-40 there has been some debate on the utility of mammogram between age 40-50 however  the current recommendation is that after your baseline mammogram  yearly mammograms start at age 40 if you have a 1 st degree relative with breast cancer at a young age  then your mammograms start 10 years prior to their age at diagnosis you should discuss the timing your with your doctor to decide what's best
1505,see allergist unless you have been tested  you cannot rule out allergies yet burning eyes is not typical for allergic conjunctivitis and more suggestive of dry eyes or an irritant reaction to eye cosmetics (mascara) and even infection vasomotor rhinitis is yet another possibility suggest that you consult an allergist
1506,nerve injury you could have swelling that is pressing on the nerve and sending pain down your leg
1507,neuromuscular the treatment includes physical therapy with traction and lumbar stretching exercises  muscle relaxer  analgesics  medications like neurontin lyrica cymbalta or amitriptyline pain clinic and acupuncture are last resort prior to consideration for surgical intervention i would consider repeating the mri if not recently done  and get neurological or pm&r evaluation for emg
1508,perhaps these are symptoms of a panic attack an individual will have several symptoms like this all at once that come on suddenly without a particular trigger so while you had symptoms of a panic attack  you did not have a full blown panic attack
1509,many possibilities you need a good dental exam if you had a clean well maintained dentition the diagnosis might be simpler but with the state of your mouth  the possibilities are endless make an appt asap and lets things under control
1510,possibly unfortunately there is no really good way to tell without being examined herpes usually causes painful sores but can itch you should try to see your doctor fairly soon because a herpes culture is more accurate in the first few days of an outbreak
1511,myopia treatment myopia and astigmatism result from an eyeball that's misshapen the only cure is to reshape it with lasik or lasek it's not like exercises or vitamins will ever work because it's not due to weakness or a nutritional deficiency
1512,viral/ bacterial infection  allergic / contact dermatitis  insect bite  autoimmune condition etc see your dr for assurance and confirmation take care !
1513,sleep supplement if no contraindications  per your doctor  it is ok also  try the sleep hygiene techniques google those words for details
1514,cancer ductal carcinoma insitu is cancer this case was probably low grade and not aggressive and taken care of by the lumpecty that helped diagnose it so no further chemo or radiation is needed i am surprised tamoxifen was not recommended  are you sure you have all the details? cancer is cancer!
1515,signs of arthritis what you relate are signs of arthritis radiographically speaking i'd've expected this type of picture more from an older person or one who suffered a significant injury to that area of the back or has been doing extensive repetitive bending & similar work for years if you were to modify what you do with your back you could slow this down if not  then  unfortunately  yes  it could progress
1516,clots you my havebloodclots from the methotrexate consult your doctor immediately
1517,i would recommend a discussion with your physician as more information @ history is needed
1518,depends on if new could represent an acute viral or bacterial process it is acute that would be the case if longer like greater than 6 weeks  it could be related to reflux see your doctor
1519,intraocular lenses there are many types of intraocular lenses (iols) which are used for cataract surgery most people have basic iols which will correct either distance or reading vision people with astigmatism can receive a toric iol to reduce this others choose to have an iol which can correct both distance and reading vision your surgeon will discuss these options with you when you're ready for surgery
1520,infection assuming the throat infection is bacterial and from the tooth and your doctor prescribed the appropriate antibiotic regimen  the infection should begin to resolve within a couple of days however  i hope your are also receiving the necessary dental treatment to address the tooth infection antibiotics alone will not eliminate the cause of the dental infection
1521,hypertension the lipid profile is ok but your blood pressure is elevated so talk with your doctor and monitor your bp every morning
1522,yes ulcers can start again in a different place see your doctor
1523,yeast yes to both questions

1525,dry dry eyes can be caused by numerous things a complete eye exam is necessary to determine the causes usually artificial tears  lid hygiene  and even changing the type of contact lenses may help reduce your eye irritation contacts made out of material allowing good flow of oxygen to the surface of the eye is highly recommended also  if all the above fails  consider placing punctal plugs in your eye to reduce dry eye symptoms http://wwweye-socalcom/eye-care-information/191-eyelid-how-is-dry-eye-treated-with-punctal-plugshtml
1526,lymph nodes it sounds as if there is some source of inflammation on that side either dental  tonsillar or other oral structures lymph nodes fight diseases for a living and they get large and tender while doing so this should resolve when the source of the inflammation recedes or is treated
1527,not always however we do worry about nodules with calcification more than other nodules as a significantly higher rate of being malignant
1528,infection you may have a bladder or vaginal infection i would see your doctor to get a definitive diagnosis
1529,blood pressure sounds like you might be developing low bp when you get up this is called orthostatic hypotension and it has many possible causes time for a doctor visit
1530,yes rotten = infection lymph nodes are designed to trap pathogens  limiting the spread of infection unless the source of infection  the diseased tooth  is addressed  the infection will eventually spread beyond the safeguard  the lymphatic system please call a dentist for care
1531,keep clean if used carefully and correctly a toothpick can be a very helpful tool for good oral hygiene but now that the area is injured you need to be careful not to aggravate it any further keep the area clean rinse with mouthwash and maybe use toothpaste on a q tip instead of bristles or floss for just a few days and the area should heal be sure you don't have a piece of the toothpick stuck in your gums
1532,normal it's normal to have absence of a period after discontinuation of the depot provera shot sometimes up to 6 months duration the pain might be related to not having a period  but it also could be gastrointestinal if it's severe then you should go to urgent care  or if not too severe  consider making appt with gynecologist for evaluation hope you feel better soon
1533,re see your doctor it is not clear what is occurring the possibilities include a reinfection or lack of cure as examples you should be rechecked would also have your sexual partner or partners checked as well before reengaging in any sexual activity suggest using appropriate barrier protection from now on
1534,jaw osteomyelitis multiple causes some of the more common would be untreated dental or sinus infections also injury  injections or prior surgery to repair jaw may cause osteomyelitis
1535,not recommended if you have stable nodule for 2 years and you have no symptoms plus non smoker then no need to repeat ct
1536,when to repeat mri if the mri is normal  it would probably not be worth repeating for awhile there is some value to using contrast and that is typical for ms protocol mri the 15 tesla strength is fine though people under consideration for ms as a diagnosis may have a repeat mri after 6 months or so hope that helps!
1537,pericornitis the gum around there has become infected it will need to be treated by having the wisdom tooth removed the doctor may prescribe antibiotics intially
1538,yes unless you are suffering from permanent nerve injury related to the problem you had recently treated  most pain radiating into the leg is treated well with medication  injections  or surgery (assuming a spine etiology) once the exact location of the nerve compression is identified any number of interventions can help you see a spine specialist to walk you through the work-up
1539,obvious untruth think if what you are saying is true  more women who have mammograms would die of breast cancer than women who have not had mammograms no one's dumb enough to claim this the actual increase in breast cancer is due mostly to women living longer and foregoing motherhood / lactation you're an adult and are smart enough to have found healthtap; don't be a sucker for obviously-false web claims
1540,probably your total cholesterol is slightly elevated your other indices are healthy  but you would probably benefit from one  as they do more than just lower your cholesterol
1541,end of optic nerve at the back of the eye  all of the nerve fibers come together to join at the optic nerve which carries the picture to the brain strangely  there are no light receiving cells over the end of the optic nerve  so it leaves a blind spot in the vision however  the brain imagines what it expects to see in the area of the blind spot  so we are not aware of this permanent hole in the vision
1542,viralgastroenteritis take plenty fluids  rest   rice and soup and avoid meat
1543,several signs shortness of breath  sharp chest pain  coughing up blood  fainting  and rapid heart rate are all common symptoms of pulmonary emboli it is one of the most challenging diagnoses to make in medicine on the basis of either symptoms or signs because of this  whenever there is a suspicion that is reasonably high  tests must be done to rule it in or out surgery  trauma  immobility cancer are risks
1544,yes it can be helpfu in addition to getting a full neurologic evaluation  treatment options for rescue or prevention can be discussed
1545,hcg if you are not pregnant and you have a detectable level of hcg  then you should be checked for the presence of a tumor that secrets hcg  because having hcg elevations apart from pregnancy is not normal
1546,hpv hpv vaccine will reduce the possibility that you will get warts but it is not %100 there are not great tests to determine if you will get warts even of you have been exposed a lot of it has to do with your immune system
1547,sounds like it swelling at the base of the thumb is most often associated with cmc arthritis a cyst can cause such a problem but it is unlikely treatment could include a steroid injection or if advanced an arthroplasty
1548,infection infection anywhere in the hand and arm and result in an enlarged painful lymph-node in the armpit
1549,yes a cta will be able to detect abnormal lung masses with fairly decent accuracy the test of choice would be a ct without contrast  however most radiologists can read through the added contrast material
1550,get eval certainly sounds like you have at the least an infection in your tonsilar area get an eval and treated as 2 months now  with weight loss is way too long to wait best wishes
1551,it happens after a viral or bacterial infection lymph nodes may remain enlarged for weeks signs to worry about are if it is hard  does not move when you try to  recurrent fever  sick looking if no other symptoms i would wait a couple of more weeks and if still the same size then take him to his pediatrician
1552,see below could be a mild case of strep throat (pharyngitis) however  sore throat even with white spots is often caused by viral infection
1553,look for diphenhydramine which is the generic of benadryl they should know what that is/have it there if you try zyrtec  take 10mg daily best of luck!
1554,breast tenderness breast tenderness naturally happens during the menstrual cycle this is considered fibrocystic changes that occur due to hormonal changes you can take pain relievers to help with the discomfort
1555,yes  but unnecessary people who have no ill symptoms and no allergy to gluten don't benefit from a gluten-free diet gluten-free foods use grains such as corn  rice  millet  quinoa  and sorghum that don't have gluten  but such foods are more expensive and harder to find however  healthy gluten-free foods are fine for anyone to eat  as long as they are part of a balanced diet
1556,see below i would keep your follow-up orthopedic evaluation  you may have a syndesmotic ligament injury besides an ankle sprain i would recommend some follow x-rays with your orthopedic surgeon when you see him promptly  in the interim continue with your aircast i would wrap it up with an ace bandage at least and keep it elevated and you could use ice 20 minutes every hour to help with swelling and don't walk on it for now use your two crutches good luck thank you
1557,see a dentist the tooth can be a potential cause of the sinus infection see a dentist to have the your teeth examined if there is significant tooth structure missing  then the tooth will need to be extracted if there is adequate tooth structure to support a crown/cap  then a root canal will be recommended
1558,see a derm this can represent an inflammation in your blood vessels called vasculitis it is important to be checked as soon as you can by a dermatologist there are other possibilities as well but given the proximity to having had surgery it is important to be seen for a thorough evaluation
1559,torn meniscus it sounds like a classic meniscus tear this is very common  but most of the time requires surgery to remove the torn segment of the meniscus rarely the tear can be repaired it sounds like you need to see an orthopaedic surgeon
1560,framingham risk using a respected calculator  the framingham risk calculator (you can google this)  assuming a high cholesterol of 250 and normal bp of 130 (even better if lower)  your risk of a heart attack is
1561,drug store dennis heyget to the dentist like  yesterday if it is an abcess the dentist will tell you you need treatment and ck the pharmacymaybe they have over the counter  common sense pills  you can take
1562,it can lung transplant for cf is an important life prolonging therapy but it exchanges one set of problems for another after transplant  there is risk of rejection of the transplanted lungs by one's own immune system requiring use of strong meds that suppress your immune system which then increases your risk of serious infections there are many facets to this - talk to your cf dr to discuss pros/cons
1563,yes viral respiratory infections frequently begin with a sore throat if your symptoms have not completely resolved  see your dr
1564,dentalinfection-er you should have responded by now-get a second opinion or er evaluation certainly call the dentist who did the extraction
1565,good treatment you did all the right things! the swelling may take many days to subside you can accelerate it by keeping off your feet and keeping your foot elevated
1566,increased platelets your platelet count of 503 is technically high  but not extremely high by any means you are also mildly anemic this anemia is most likely due to iron deficiency as this is the most common cause by far in young women further tests would confirm this if necessary and yes  iron deficiency is one cause of a high platelet count continue to sort this out with your doctor
1567,probably not lyrica tends to be better tolerated than neurontin if you have concerns  contact your prescribing physician
1568,the probability is very low  but it is theoretically possible the virus can only live a couple of hours outside the body on an inanimate object  so contact must be almost immediate also  it must enter the body through a mucus membrane or wound
1569,sinusitis likely sinusitis see md for exam/xray/probable antibiotics
1570,cavities always 1st it is important to get cavities treated as soon as possible before wisdom teeth removal however  an infected wisdom tooth can be very very serious and the first line of treatment
1571,no alcohol can lead to cirrhosis but alcohol related cirrhosis does not always lead to cancer
1572,it is likely the prolonged bleeding which has contributed to vulvovaginitis it sounds like you need to see your doc antibiotics or a medicine for yeast would likely help the swelling you may need the birth control pill or some hormone to help the bleeding do this before you develop anemia good luck
1573,stress? mild mvp rarely if ever causes symptoms assuming you have had 2 normal stress tests  pain that comes after heavy meals sounds more like gerd than heart origin you might try omeprazole for a couple of weeks and see if the discomfort stops
1574,probably breast augmentation alone does not affect the ability to breastfeed the periareolar approach will still preserve most if not all of the ducts http://wwwdassmdcom/breast-augmentation/indexhtml
1575,not migraine there are many causes of dizziness if there is a true spinning sensation it is called vertigo and usually is due to a disturbance of the vestibular part of the inner ear if it is more of a lightheadedness it's often due to anxiety or stress for a patient oriented discussion of this topic see: bitly/1yzi7rd at patientcouk website
1576,need a detailed exam insomnia has many causes from psychiatric causes to hormonal causes my advice is to consult with your family physician and have him/her run some blood tests and then possibly refer you to a sleep specialist

1578,size matters depending on the size of the cavity and how far is extends across the different sides of the tooth  a cerec restoration could be worth the investment when a dentist recommends a composite resin filling  it is usually the best treatment for that tooth to restore it to optimal form and function we budget is a concern  sometimes a dentist will offer choices ask your dentist about each tooth
1579,need information those are symptoms that need to be addressed there just isnt enough information i would want lab tests  such as thyroid  and sugar testing stomach tests such as upper gi and gallbladder test  your physical exam should also reveal more pcos would lend itself to endocrine problems  such as sugar and thyroid  weight gain  hair growth and is very common  1 in 20 women
1580,yes and no if you were actively having an episode of say blurred vision or weakness  then yes if the mri is done at the time you have symptoms  it should be visible its unlikely though that your symptoms are due to ms  as they are not consistent with the disease migraine is more common  and also analgesic overuse  post-concussive  and occipital nerve related headache more likely lp is the definitive test
1581,typical healing this is quite typical after surgical extractions of wisdom teeth remember to follow the instruction that the oral  surgeon gave you use ice packs for the swelling  15 minutes on then 15 minutes off nutrition is important for healing  so soft diet  yogurt  cool soups  ensure  boost limit talking this can take several days to heal call surgeon if you have concerns  but this sounds normal

1585,breast pain if there is something i never take lightly it's breast pain any time i ever have a patient describe breast pain to me  i always have the patient come into the office for an exam and possible sonogram i would suggest contacting either your primary physician or gyn for an exam  particularly if you are in pain such as you decribe
1586,swollen feet very unlikely
1587,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs/carries things too big to go into the arteries/veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph for anything bad like bacteria/viruses/cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well
1588,treat if red eyes if he wakes up with eyes stuck together from dried secretions and a pinkish to red eye  i would treat if no redness  not stuck together  and discharge is occasional and not heavy yellow or green  then can supplement with artificial tears 1-2 x a day or let it resolve in its own

1592,low grade arthritis! i have many patients with ccps > 250 with minimal disease activity other indicators of disease activity more important than ccp titer are: albumin/globulin ratio higher the better and anemia hgb goes down with disease activity i would base treatment on disease activity  not the ccp tests crp and esr being normal are far more important in activity assessment  along with active synovitis!
1593,yes however  chance of recurrence is much reduced because of radiation this is the reason that radiation is the standard of care after breast conservation surgery chance of local recurrence is reduced by about 2/3
1594,lazy lazy eye is generally permanent after the age of 11 or 12 if she is younger than this  i strongly encourage you to wear her glasses once the brain no longer wants the vision from an eye  that eye will never have the chance of better vision there is a window to teach the brain to use an eye vision could get worse  but more importantly it will never get better
1595,may  usually not a regular ct scan of the abdomen  without bowel preparation is not an ideal way to detect colon cancer many lesions are likely to be masked by the fecal matter large lesions may be discernible 3d ct scan  after bowel preparation would be better to detect colon cancer endoscopy is the better way  as polyp can be removed and suspicious lesions biopsied
1596,hmmmmm if i were you  i would first see my physician or an ent specialist your problem may or may not be related to the removal of your wisdom tooth if your md cannot find any medical cause  i would see your dentist  which wouldn't be bad idea anyway just to be sure everything is healing well
1597,not necessarily generally  it is better to have a culture in order to identify the bacteria and ensure that it is sensitive to the antibiotic chosen it is possible for non-infectious problems to cause symptoms similar to a uti if the symptoms do not resolve after a course of antibiotics you should probably return for a urine culture prior to further treatment
1598,mole a new mole  or one which bleeds or changes color may be a concern discuss this with you dermatologist as soon as possible

1611,dementias senile dementias  multi infarct dementias  and organic dementias such as from metabolic or endocrine diseases
1612,no while swelling can remain for upto a year swelling after carpal tunnel is typically minor and should be resolved for the most part by now i recommend following up with your hand surgeon

1614,cannot say every lab i've ever seen puts 300 as totally normal every text says the cells should be big in megaloblastic anemia (hi mcv  etc) low iron  small cells  low crit with iron deficiency most common type of anemia without an exam  i can only give general information
1615,normal both are within normal range
1616,possible unlikely  but possible check home preg
1617,not ms causation yes  ms patients do have susceptibility for infections  but relapses do not cause temperature elevation  and your high fever does need medical attention furthermore  elevated temps can promote ms pseudo relapses  and viral infections can trigger true relapses
1618,probably it's not uncommon for someone to have an anxiety disorder and add/adhd however  medicating both can be tricky stimulants like ritalin can worsen anxiety the diagnosis of add should be carefully made often psychological tests done by psychologists help to confirm add especially in young adults adding ritalin is safe  but follow-up md visits are important do not drink alcohol on these meds
1619,pain management pain sensation varies so much that it is impossible to describe my experience will never be the same as yours however  since post-operative discomfort is expected for many  your surgical team can help you manage it this will be like any other surgeries--managing your condition will be just as important as surgery itself please ask your surgical team about what plan they have for you

1636,abdominal pain it could be but at your age  it typically is not
1637,chemoembolization chemoembolization is a good option for patients who are not candidates for other therapies  but it is not a good choice when liver function is poor in general  we don't do chemoembolization in patients with bilirubin levels above 3 0  baseline encephalopathy  or ast or alt levels above 100 (unless the patient has hepatitis  in which case 100 is not too bad) blood clotting issues are usually correctable and should not impact the plan to do chemoembolization chemoembolization is not considered curative  but rather palliative that means that it slows the tumor down  which may help to keep the patient within acceptable limits for transplantation external beam radiation is not usually used in liver cancer because the normal liver is more sensitive to radiation than the tumor is on the other hand  it is often possible to do internal radiation with a technique called selective internal radiation therapy (sirt)  also known as radioisotope embolization this technique can be used in patients with very compromized liver function and appears to be very effective here are the names and phone numbers of two doctors in arizona who use the sirt technique: charles k raker  md - (602) 239-4622 phoenix  az - dept of radiology banner good samaritan hospital william j romano  md  fsir - (480) 440-9784 phoenix  az - mdig/vip

1653,yes you should follow your doctor's advice it is a good one although most likely cause of your bloody stool is hemorrhoids  you are at risk of colo rectal cancer other possibilities include ulcerative colitis  crohn's disease  and diverticulosis  all of which can be accurately diagnosed with colonoscopy also  if you bleed in large amounts  it can cause anemia or even shock
1654,sinus most likely sinus congestion  the nasal sinus can be inflamed without the posterior sinuses being affected try a decongestant and see if you get a few hours of relief before the symptoms recur
1655,yes scaphoid fractures are sometimes difficult to visualize on x-rays  especially initially after an injury if you have tenderness at the base of your thumb near the wrist  it is reasonable to splint or cast the wrist until follow-up x-rays confirm the absence of any fracture occasionally  an mri study can be useful to rule out a scaphoid fracture definitively

1676,treat fracture what is the cause of the fracture? was it due to a fall or trauma or because there is weak area in the bone due to spread of the cancer? the fracture must be stabilized so that lisa can be as mobile as possible to prevent blood clots people with cancer are at increased for blood clot the orthopedic oncologist can then consult with the oncologist as to optimum time for cancer treatment
1677,manipulation manipulation is usually performed within the first 6 weeks in the motion remains poor

1684,probably not the infection is most like not in your vertebrae however you need to return to gp if you are still having symptoms clindamycin may be a drug choice and probably does not need to be administered iv at this time check back with your gp soon as these infections can become life threatening
1685,possible new case while you were successful in treating your previous strep throat  a new case can always occur if you are exposed to a sick contact (especially a child) please go to your primary care doctor for a strep test and possible repeat antibiotic treatment in addition to strep  some particularly bothersome infections can happen behind the tonsil  pushing it forward a good exam should handle this too :-)
1686,1) no no  raloxifene is not the only drug in its class another example of a drug with similar efficacy is arzoxifene they all work the same and have the same side effects yes  raloxifene seems to increase bone mineral density and prevent spinal fractures (there isn't enough data to say on hip fractures  however) tamoxifen is the oldest drug in this class and has similar effects on bone

1693,yes  sometimes slight changes in mammographic positioning can cause what looks like a new area of density  which subsequently disappears on additional views because it wasn't really an actual change in the first place

1704,not helpful generally  there is no great improvement to taking cough medicine none of the over the counter cough medicines really have much effect fluid intake and rest are the best medication interactions are common
1705,i i thought dr christensen's answer was spot-on  but i'd like to add my two cents in general  the presenting symptom of poor circulation is pain  not numbness numbness is a symptom of a nerve problem when you fall asleep on your arm and it feels numb and pins-and-needle-like  it's because you've compressed a nerve  not cut off the circulation when you have a heart attack  it's because an area of the heart muscle isn't getting enough oxygenated blood  and you feel pain people with poor circulation in their legs can't walk because of pain  not numbness (incidentally  diabetics who frequently feel numbness  burning  etc in their feet are feeling problems with how their nerves function it's not circulation that causes this) if you began feeling numbness in your calves right after your back surgery  i think it's a remarkable coincidence it's hard to believe you developed poor circulation right after having surgery on your back nerves that bring sensation from the legs to the brain have to pass through the spinal cord  and any compression to the spinal cord or nerve roots can cause all sorts of symptoms in the legs & feet as dr christensen explained  the nerves in your back could be responding to the swelling and trauma of being manipulated during surgery if so  this usually clears up in time when you say the pulse in one foot is slower than the other  i'm guessing you mean it feels weaker; less strong the best way to determine if you really do have an issue with circulation is to have plethysmography done  which is a simple  painless test to measure the circulation in your legs a vascular surgeon is the type of doctor who would do this if your circulation is fine and it's just the nerves in your back that are responding to surgical manipulation  you'll probably be fine in a few weeks if the symptoms persist  acupuncture helps this nicely good luck!
1706,worrisome the symptoms you describe are very worrisome  in particular i am concerned about possible cancer i would see a physician asap and get some blood work drawn to check counts and other labs
1707,postop problem you should not have swelling  tenderness and heat in your jaw after a month all your symptoms suggest a postoperative infection of the soft tissue or bone  possibly a subperiosteal abscess or even osteomyelitis you should return to see the oral surgeon who removed your wisdom teeth you may require treatment with antibiotics  or a procedure to drain the infection or remove infected bone
1708,get examined for stomach  gallbladder  liver  spleen  kidney  and intestinal inflammation or infection take care!
1709,mfp myofascial pain syndrome is characterized by: increased muscle fatigue and stiffness  a mildly restricted range of motion  pain when the muscle is stretched  and a subjective feeling of weakness in the muscle tension type headache  tmj pain and vertigo may also be present rec: see orofacial pain specialist for further investigation

1711,red/circle/tag??? nit sure? bed bug bites a guess best to seek in person examination from a doctor
1712,yes there are many causes of leg pain and dvt is only one d-dimer is not sensitive enough to exclude all blood clots and it does not evaluate for venous insufficiency a duplex for both obstruction and insufficiency to evaluate your deep and superficial veins is a good start there are other causes of leg pain such as myositis  referred pain from nerve compression etc that a doctor can help with
1713,probably not directl mitral valve prolapse is a description of how the mitral valve closes it can be associated with a leaking mitral valve if the leak is large enough it can cause parts of the heart to expand and dilate this can predispose you to develop all sorts of rhythm issues but most who have prolapse don't develop svt's because most do not have any significant leak
1714,yes a normal echo usually means the valves and pumping action of your heart is normal however you would need a stress test and nuclear scan of your heart to see if the circulation in your heart is normal  and to see if you have any evidence of a heart attack good luck!
1715,pregnant? what you described simulates symptoms of pregnancy  but obtain a serum test from your healthcare professional  and it will be decisive then see your healthcare professional for advice and treatment
1716,if 2 docs agree then it sounds good we are not privy to your x-rays and so can't really comment otherwise
1717,this this could indicate a cracked tooth  especially if it had a root canal unfortunately this is one of the hardest problems to diagnose i would recommend an evaluation by an endodontist a new technology called cbt (cone beam x-ray) is showing some promise in finding cracked teeth you may just have to let the situation declare itself more before acting with insufficient evidence of what is truly wrong as it may lead to unnecessary treatment

1734,white fillings yes the metal fillings can be replaced with white fillings we usually do not replace them unless they need to be replaced because of decay of fractcures but you can request they be done if the fillings are really large they will need to be replaced with a crown ( tooth colored ) the latest generation of white fillings last as long as metal fillings
1735,part of the process the process of dental bonding is a general procedure by which fillings  crowns  veneers  orthodontic brackets can be connected to teeth it is a biochemical process by which these materials literally become chemically bonded to the tooth structure the process is technique sensitive and varies slightly for each type of procedure  but it is very often used with fillings & very successful!

1743,dominant arm strongr since als is a painless weakness  and you do not have weakness  als should not be considered the cause if you use the dominant arm for weights and do not use the other arm  the muscles will be different sizes normally they are pretty close the easiest way to sort this out is to see if you can make the left arm stronger that would rule out an illness
1744,yes  time for mri patellar dislocations may have concurrent acl/mcl tears  but this is relatively uncommon inability to bend the knee could be due to a fracture  significant swelling or a mechanical block like a loose body (bone  cartilage piece) it's time to have a further evaluation by your orthopedic specialist  and most likely  an mri will be ordered

1749,more information if you are college age  the best thing is salt gargles  but i use 1 tablespoon in 6 oz of warm water  to gargle and spit out antibiotics do help get rid of strep more quickly  but won't help you feel better sooner  and most sore throats are viral  so no antibiotic will help if you are in grade school  which i doubt  you should be seen  as the risk of complications from strep are greater

1753,? viral vs allergy to food or drug allergy testing at this point is not the most needed test  probably rast blood test  for foods would be warranted  but not a priority   allergy skin prick testing can be deferred with the acute stage of hives  mostly it could viral infection or reaction to a certain food  or due to a drug  start with diphenhydramine  see his doctor now  might need an allergist evaluation later
1754,radiation radiation treatment causes permanent and  frequently  progressive changes in tissue your best result may require repeated procedures if undertaken prematurely why don't you believe your treating physicians?

1765,possible  possible  please see a dermatologist asap
1766,yes i'm sorry you are dealing with this if there is melanoma found in your liver then yes it would likely be considered as having spread from your original melanoma this is assuming that there isn't a new melanoma somewhere else- having had choroidal melanoma doesn't mean you couldn't later get another skin melanoma but absent another source  the choroidal would be the assumed source

1776,lymphedema if a person has had surgery in the axilla to check for lymph nodes  they can be at risk for lymphedema or arm swelling this surgery disrupts the passage way for fluid to drain from the arm which then causes swelling thankfully  lymphedema from breast surgery is not a profound as it once was since less lymph nodes are removed
1777,not really floaters in the eye have several causes the most common cause is degeneration of the vitreous fluid the floaters gradually get worse  and persist this may be what you have sudden increase in floaters may be caused by vitreous separation (detachment) and may associated with a retinal tear or detachment  and eye exam is advisable in both of these situations  the floaters persist
1778,yes if the crack allows for bacteria to infect the root and/or gums then the lymph nodes draining that part of your mouth will react and enlarge

1791,no your doctor will follow your progress clinically  but there is no test per se however it is a little unusual to need chemotherapy for stage 1 breast cancer  so i presume you are using one of the herceptin-type antibody agents targeted at a specific type of cancer the doctor will use examination and xrays - mammogram  ct usually - to follow your progress
1792,agree w dr haupt besides having medications optimized by a psychiatrist - are you involved with non-medication forms of treatment? talk about feelings ; address problems don't avoid them aim for 75 - 8 hours of sleep/ night daily physical activity is optimal in a green space eat healthfully cut out junk carbs  caffeine ; alcohol (or moderate) try qi gong  tai chi  acupuncture  acupressure  homeopathy  
1793,yes rhinoplasty and sinus surgery is commonly done together see a facial plastic surgeon with an ent background who can do both together
1794,need more info you gave predicted value but what was your actual value by definition  asthma is reversable airway disease  ie once you treat it  your lungs return to baseline normal in contrast  copd  your airways will not return to normal but rather reach a lower than normal baseline depending on how severe you are thre are four leverl of disease and you get catagorized based on a lung function test
1795,the the calluses should not cause pain there are multiple possible causes for this type of foot pain i cannot tell from the nature of your pain and its location what the cause is some treatments are very simple including that for porokeratosis which may look like a callus but be painful i advise you to always wear a shoe or good soled slipper when walking even around your house see a podiatrist for a clear diagnosis the pain is not normal and it may not be related to the diabetes
1796,chest pains sounds like it is not cardiac with 2 normal ekgs may be more a muskuloskeletal issue keep up with dr to get diagnosis and eventual tx
1797,pharyngitis it sounds like you have a throat infection i would see a doctor about some treatment i think you'll feel better soon
1798,depends on the cause there are multiple causes of knee effusion most involve inflammation related to injury or arthritis ice  elevations and anti-inflammatories can be started at home if swelling persists then see an ortho doc to examine knee drainage with a needle can be done in the office setting mri is very sensitive at detecting fluid in the knee and can identify about 95% of injuries in the knee
1799,impetigo? sounds like you may have a fungal infection that has bacteria in it too since you're getting yellow discharge you need to see a healthcare provider
1800,yes but your pregnancy test should be positive 2 weeks after the iui or intercourse it is likely you are not pregnant but if it does turn out positive later  it might not be from the iui
1801,yes see pulmonologist
1802,it can be aspirated assuming that the mass is actually a ganglion cyst  it can often be successfully aspirated or sucked out with a needle unfortunately  the cyst often recurs after aspiration the only way to truly remove the cyst is with surgery
1803,trauma unfortunately   there are lots of structures that can be injured with trauma to the foot   not just bones see your podiatrist for x rays and an evaluation
1804,stimulation if these tests are all normal  problem may be breast stimulation which can even make it possible for adoptive mothers to breast feed infants  some drugs can also cause galactorrhea it sounds like your work up has been pretty complete
1805,dermatological dermatological conditions are always difficult to diagnose without seeing them if they are new and itchy  then conditions such as hives should be considered if they are flat and scaly  a viral rash like pityriasis could be considered  these are usually reddish however if they have a clear vesicle (bubble) on top  then chicken pox should be considered consulting a physician for a rash on a child is always a good idea  so the best advice would be to have her doctor take a look at that
1806,keep it clean if no acces to care - try to keep oral cavity as clean as possible if there is a small pocket of pus(absces) - let it drain and rinse mouth with hydrogen peroxide diluted or any good alcohol may work too in remote areafor pain try if available tylenol or motrin and see dentist asap
1807,see orthopedist arthritis of the shoulder could present with the symptoms described for starters xrays of the arm and shoulder could help rule out pathology in the bone rotator cuff tears can present with lateral upper arm pain and wekaness an mri can diagnose a tear ofcourse  neck can refer pain to the shoulder in addition a myriad of other possibilities needs to be entertained so pls see an orthopedist
1808,can happen it may be a while before periods normalize after stopping depot  especially if you were on it for a year or longer make sure though that other causes of missed period including a pregnancy are ruled out
1809,rash is not ok a rash is telling you that something is not well it is very rare to see anybody show an allergic reaction to amoxicillin  however it can happen the rash may be a result of something else that the patient is having happen at the same time therefore  it is good to have the dentist and/or physician evaluate what is occurring with this patient at this time
1810,stress fracture get an x=ray to rule out a fracture it could also be a capsulitis
1811,not a good idea you could dislodge the clot
1812,i would try taking the prescription metanx it is a vitamin that works very well with small nerve fiber neuropathy
1813,knee instability a torn acl will result in instability you can demonstrate it by having someone pull forward on your leg just below the knee while you are seated with your legs dangling a torn acl will allow the knee on the affected side to move forward much more than on the healthy knee torn medial or lateral menisci can also cause instability  and tend to hurt more or buckle on twisting
1814,yes see your urologist for immediate management which may include a procedure to place a ureteral stent (tube helping to drain the kidney if blocking stone) all depends on labs (blood urine tests) and signs of infection this becomes emergent if you have severe pain  nausea  vomiting  fever (>1004 degrees f)  or if you are diabetic later treatment includes using camera and/or shock waves
1815,anemia these values show that your anemia is not due to blood loss but is due to chronic inflammation which suppresses your bone marrow function resulting in chronic anemia your md or a hematologist can advise you as to whether further tests are warranted
1816,tmjoint this is related to a dislocation of your temporomandibular joint(s) apply moist heat to the outside of your face just opposite your jaw joint  use advil  motrin or aleve if you can take them  and stick on a soft diet for awhile even if this improves quickly  have your tmjoints and occlusion evaluated by a dentist to determine if this was just a quirk or a precursor to a chronic condition
1817,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs/carries things too big to go into the arteries/veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph for anything bad like bacteria/viruses/cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well
1818,probably not coarse breath sounds when breathing is unlabored is generally not a concern the sounds from upper airway get transmitted to chest and make many parents fear pneumonia at that age  significant lung disease usually causes marked feeding trouble if feeding reasonably well and breathing unlabored  then the noise is not likely dangerous
1819,breast cancer doescancer does occur in men if there is any family history or a distinct mass  definately get a mammogram
1820,your your theory makes sense type 2 diabetes usually is a very slow  gradual onset  and it takes years of subtle symptoms before the diagnosis is finally made pregnancy  due to weight gain and hormones  tends to make it more diagnosable we put women with gestational diabetes on insulin only because we can't put them on the oral medication they would otherwise be on if they weren't pregnant  but that doesn't make them insulin dependent (type 1) diabetics many times  after they deliver  their diabetes returns to a state of undetection  without the need for any medication  but eventually  most women who develop gestational diabetes go on to become type 2 diabetics peripheral neuropathy can be mysterious  and diabetes isn't the only cause  despite it being the most common you can't prove your neuropathy is directly related to a sub-clinical state of diabetes  but if your neuropathy improves dramatically after you deliver  that's pretty impressive clinical proof that your neuropathy is related to diabetes you'll have to watch your blood sugars and carbohydrate intake closely  and be mindful of the fact that it's likely  some day  you'll require oral medication to control your diabetes
1821,see your pediatricia lactose intolerance means difficulty digesting milk sugar dairy allergy means an allergy to milk protein patients could have both problems a 4 mo old more likely has milk allergy a soy based formula may be the answer speak to your pediatrician
1822,yes it sometimes can but it is not able to do so reliably the cancer has to be relatively large to be seen special ct colonography is performed at many centers for screening purposes my preference for colon cancer screening is colonoscopy as biopsy can be performed of any suspicious areas during the exam (not possible with ct colonography)
1823,neurology help so you have ms  but you do not use medicine for it do you have a neurologist? if you do  this would be a good time to let them know about your symptoms they would want to know that you have a mild ms flare if you want they might be able to help you with this perhaps flares can be prevented with some medical treatment hope that helps!
1824,coincidental flu shots rarely cause side effects nowadays you would have got it regardless of the flu shots when i recommended vaccination for shingles to one of my elderly patients   the patient declined only to develop a case of shingles 2 weeks later she would have blamed the shingles on the vaccine had she obtained it
1825,a yeast infection or a uti is nothing compared to other things he might give you he is not good for you
1826,depends on location the fluid could be around the lungs also known as pleural effusions if this is the case then possible thoracentesis if large sometimes diuretics may help if fluid in the lungs this could be congestive failure this would require an echo and again diuretics pneumonia is possible if elevated white cell count or aspiration during procedure this is treated with antibiotics
1827,maybe consider a doctor visit to confirm
1828,skin lesion see your doctor now!! the patch described may be just a simple mole but it probably needs a biopsy to be sure the warmth and itching of your breast could be related to infection  allergy or something far more concerning do not delay a full evaluation

1837,primarily the most common area that osteoarthritis affects in the hands would be the 1st cmc (carpometacarpal) joint this corresponds to the the base of the thumb near the wrist of course other types of arthritis can certainly affect this area as well all the best!
1838,you decide ultimately  if you have undiagnosed pain in your luq for a year  it would be recommended to get the condition evaluated and eventually diagnosed you need to ultimately decide if the discomfort is something you can live with (since it has been a year already and i assume you have not lost weight  or have any other symptoms  etc) in the end though  best to be safe and get an answer good luck
1839,stay home sounds like a flu-like illness try some dayquil and nyquil according to the label directions and rest up the next few days it may take 2-3 weeks to be back to normal but you should start feeling a little better in 3-5 days stay home today save your money

1846,vertigo in general  significant vertigo with nystagmus is a problem with the peripheral vestibular system if less severe  nystagmus could be less if central vertigo an anatomically normal mri is reassuring but that test does not assess the function of the system formal testing by vestibular specialists is often recommended and sometimes then rehab make sure the mri reading is good  also
1847,time pt meds epidura most get better with time exercise  weight control and smoking cessation help if these are issues medication  physical therapy and epidural steroid injections can also play a role if indicated
1848,yes yes the line between neuropathic pain and rls pain is often very blurred the symptoms often tend to run together that's why some drugs can be used to treat both
1849,unclear not sure i understand your question stress incontinence is the involuntary loss of urine with strain such as coughing  laughing  sneezing  lifting i'm not sure what you mean byself we frequently talk about genuine or urodynamic stress incontinence based on how it is diagnosed but i have never heard the term self stress incontinence

1930,chest x-ray a chest x-ray can spot a lesion which maybe lung cancer additional test would be necessary to confirm cancer an echo is an ultrasound of the heart it would not directly show a lesion the lung is full of air which does not work well with echo
1931,chest pain atypical chest pain is difficult to deal with at times i see you have had an ekg and i assume it was normal although you may not be having acute coronary syndrome  you may be having some type of pericariditis or pleurisy costochondritis or sternal wall pain the sharp pains could also be caused by intercostal irritation

1935,vein issue this could be related to a vein problem which is not uncommon both during and after pregnancy the veins in the legs bring blood back to the heart and if they have leaky valves this could result in swelling of the legs also  if there is a blockage or clot in the veins then this could result in the same type of symptoms elevating your legs may likely help alleviate the swelling
1936,well benign lymph nodes are not palpable also on breast mri they can tell if it was a lymph node by its shape and enhancement pattern the problem is that lymph nodes have a washout pattern similar to that seen with cancer i do not think the mammogram will help but you can do it on a 3d hologics digital unit this needs followup

1939,need more testing a noncontrast ct is a good screening exam for many conditions  but may not be as sensitive as mri you should be examined by a neurologist  and if he feels that it is warranted  a contrast mri study will afford a more precise diagnosis

1941,odds are not screening mmgs involve 2 quick views - one from the top and one from the side depending on how hard they pull or squeeze or position the breast  tissue can overlap and look more dense with additional compression  this spreads out and disappears thus benign if its a true mass  the surrounding tissue thins and the mass becomes more obvious characteristics of calcs are better seen on mag views
1942,thyroid nodules thyroid nodules are divided in hot or cold by thyroid nuclar scan cold nodules are the one's than in some % may be cancerous and require biopsy any tissue that grows too fast is suspicious for malignancy we also dive thyroid ovules in functional ( with changes in the thyroid hormones) and not functional ( with normal thyroid dunction tests)
1943,if if he is truly bleeding behind the eye and not in the eye  then the blood loss is in the eye socket (the orbit) and can be due to many causes some of these causes are spontaneous (rupture of an aneurysm) and some are due to trauma he should stop blood thinners (lots of different kinds) after consulting with his pcp
1944,yes unless you are suffering from permanent nerve injury related to the problem you had recently treated  most pain radiating into the leg is treated well with medication  injections  or surgery (assuming a spine etiology) once the exact location of the nerve compression is identified any number of interventions can help you see a spine specialist to walk you through the work-up

1947,it will help if you are placed on clindamycin your tooth has an infection it is important that you take it as prescribed and take the prescription to completion  even if you feel great take care
1948,probably not of course if reschedule cancer is present in the breast tissue near the nipple it can't recur and spread into the skin when this happens it is called p'eau d'orange skin and it causes red thick skin the doctors are aware of this and have elected to have your nipple and skin around the nipple spared so they are not too concerned about this event you should not worry because it is a very low likelihood giving the chemo and radiation hopefully you'll be tumor free
1949,go to er with those symptoms  log off your computer and have your parents take you to the emergency room  right now
1950,19 weeks? if you are truly 19 weeks the likelihood of ectopic pregnancy is very close to zero; most will have ruptured (a surgical emergency) by about 12-13 weeks
1951,not likely most lymphomas present with enlarged nodes somewhere it may require cts of chest/ abdomen and specific blood test (esr  flow cytometry) and bone marrow exam to raise level of certainty there is no perfect way to prove a negative- you do not have it- but we can certainly make it less likely more commonly weight loss is related to inflammation and infection or other illnes than hidden lymphoma
1952,no such thing there isn't actually such an entity per se but people with diabetes tend to develop accelerated atherosclerosis which tends to affect the smaller (distal) vessels to a greater extent than non-diabetics that could result in angina (chest pain)but often doesn't because diabetics lose the ability to perceive pain dizziness and cold fingers are non-specific issues caused by many things
1953,probably not but many troubled teens self medicate with drugs
1954,not necessarily groin pain could be primarily from the spinal problems  but also may be a core muscle imbalance due to compensation for the pain caused by the disc disease a proper evaluation  and mri can help figure that out physical therapy may also be helpful in that situation hope this helps!
1955,concordance very good typically  continued follow-up will be performed  up to 2 years total

1967,based based on the symptoms you described you could be dealing with pharyngitis (infection of the throat) which could be caused by a bacterial or a virus; versus a sinus infection other more serious less likely possibilities include influenza (flu) or meningitis (infection of the central nervous system) regardless  you need to see your health care provider right away; the provider will ask you specific questions about your illness and perform a physical exam you can expect that your provider will likely perform a throat culture or a test called a rapid strep test and possibly blood tests to check for certain infections your doctor/provider will make a decision based on the test results regarding which treatment is appropriate if a more serious problem is suspected  your doctor will likely send you to the emergency department

2138,that and others sudafed can help but try not to use it for a prolonged time there are anti-allergy meds that can help also i find nasal saline irrigation to helps me and my patients it seems weird at first  but hang in there  it is actually quite good at relieving nose related symptoms
2139,see dentist asap the only treatment is to see your dentist and get definitive treatment antibiotics only temporize the situation and do not solve it
2140,no this internet claim was made up to look like real science  but it's not it was generated to frighten young men who belong to one of the cults whether a man goes bald is almost entirely a function of his genetics  and correlates closely with how much chest hair he is naturally blessed with be discerning and don't let foolish people feed you disinformation best wishes
2141,neuropathy you should see a neurologist to further evaluate the nerve symptoms if the scan of your brain and cervical spine was normal  then perhaps you need a thoracic spine mri and blood analysis for certain causes of peripheral neuropathy
2142,foot pain this could be a simple sprain  to damaged ligaments to hairline fracture etc  firstly you need to get an x-ray and have the foot evaluated
2143,get checked even if you are fit  exercise  and feel normal  should get your heart checked out by your md  
2144,yes this should be checked by a professional to make certain that nothing serious is in progress good luck
2145,best to see your pc there are several possibilities and an exam by your pc and culture should yield the answer
2146,sort of pinched nerve in the neck can do those things  especially the hands for the legs i would be suspicious of another pinched nerve but in the lumbar spine
2147,depends not enough information depends on tnm staging treatment decisions based on that as well as biomarkers - er  pr  her2/neu the absolute risk reduction provided by chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy can then be individualized on useful online tool is adjuvant! online that assumes adequate local control - eg surgery +/- radiation
2148,needs evaluation 1 in 9 american women get breast cancer i would recommend a breast exam by your obgyn and a mammogram with a breast ultrasound if your breasts are dense it is good the heart is cleared it is most likely fibrocystic breasts which cause pain and is worsened by caffeine i like you thinking to always rule out the worst possibility
2149,yes yes  just make sure you keep the tissues clean and free of any residual food and bacteria you can rinse with listerine or scope after brushing to help reduce bacterial growth
2150,i recommend both a ct scan and a biopsy by ent would work to identify the diagnosis
2151,doubtful your depression could fully explain most of your symptoms  but the tingling could be due to hyperventilation  medication side effects  or even a peripheral neuropathy of any cause you do not describe any issues consistent with ms
2152,asthma can be mild asthma is defined as reversible bronchoconstrictrion  this can be mild that it can only be detected by lung function test some asthma patients only realize their condition after a puff of albuterol  as they get use to a mildly reduce pulmonary capacity
2153,probably normal however  you want to visit your doc and ask about a tilt test  meaning you are a little upside down and then your position will go up no big deal but better be safe good luck
2154,joint dysfunction your left tmj likely has medial (to the midline) displacement of the cartilage disc this allows the joint to be further up in the socket  hence the jaw shift the noise is the cartilage disc snapping back into place when opening without examination the growth cannot be commented on  so a visit to dentist or dermatologist is warranted
2155,your weight may be causing the swelling i suggest you see your pcp
2156,crest syndrome could be crest syndrome or limited scleroderma it has no known cure  and treatments focus on managing symptoms and preventing serious complications symptoms include tight  hardened skin usually in lower arms ; legs  including fingers and toes another symptom is raynaud's phenomenon  where small blood vessels in your fingers and toes go into spasms in response to cold or emotional stress
2157,radial artery occlus a simple in home way of checking your circulation and getting first impression of its status would be to check your radial artery pulse just distal to your thumb base if the occlusion is higher on the arm but the pulse is present  it's a good sign  then the occlusion is not total if there is no pulse there  you may push on your fingernail usually blood comes back in less than 2 secs
2158,possible ulcer this may be an aphthous ulcer  but if persists should be checked
2159,thank thank you for your excellent description of your problem i also love when there is a photo  however the link you provided didn't lead to a photo  but an error but from your description  i'd say you have an onychia  which is a little infection along the base of the toenail  probably from irritation during the run the typical scenario is a tiny blister forms from irritation with continued irritation  the blister breaks and bacteria invade to produce a small  localized infection it's not serious  and unless there is overt redness  heat and swelling or a pocket of pus  it will probably subside on its own (assuming you're in good health  not a diabetic  no poor circulation  etc) keep it covered with a band aid  especially when you run warm water soaks will help too if you keep getting this  you may want to get some roll foam to cover your toe while you run to prevent irritation to the area in rare occurrences  the nail needs to be removed to allow pus to drain  but this hardly ever is needed hope this helps happy running!
2160,sure er works if seeing your family doc is not an option
2161,tonsillitisviral? tonsillitis can be caused by a virus sometimes it is strep  if your child is not getting better maybe it is the virus causing the fever but if it continues into day four or something has changed i would call your doctor and maybe have your daughter seen againbut definitely call your doctor and discuss your concerns
2162,lumbar pain it seems like you have lumbar radiculopathy ( pain caused by irritation of s1 nerve roots)  l5/s1 disc can definitely cause this to better answer the question i would need more details shoot me an email at rtalac@gmailcom would be happy to help
2163,if you are worried the best thing to do would be to have it biopsied then  we'll know for sure exactly what it is
2164,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs/carries things too big to go into the arteries/veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph for anything bad like bacteria/viruses/cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well
2165,combo as both medications are sedating  i would avoid using them in combination -- you need to isolate why you are not sleeping -- if anxiety driven  xanax may be more effective if you have primary insomnia  ambien may be more effective do not combine
2166,if if you are sure you are swollen  then have it checked out to whom you go is a personal decision however  sometimes after cleanings your gums just feel a little swollen but are not actually swollen if you have any doubt or concern  by all means have it looked at
2167,it depends it really depends on the severity of the arthritis bracing and injectable lubricants may be helpful
2168,anas not marker for anas not markers for cancer of course  any undefined pain could be ca  but at your age very unlikely your systemic lupus panel does exonerate you from likely connective tissue disease  and your other tests are ok  except for the esr i would have my pcp get a crp esrs in my opinion should rarely be done if crp elevated  probably inflammation somewhere  the more likely cause for pain!
2169,more time needed trauma to the nerve and elbow from the surgery nerve block and other related medical procedures has occurred your elbow will continue to feel numb for a while inflammatory tissue seems to promote this funny feeling give it a three to five days for the numbness to go awaycall your pmd if it has not improved w/in a week or so
2170,yes this probably developed into an abscess you will need to go to your podiatrist to get this taken care of this is very routine and will be done in the office they will numb your toe and remove the side of the nail and clean out the infection good luck
2171,not to worry while we hate to order ct's mainly because of the radiation  one ct should not effect any risk of cancer for you now or in the future to put it in perspective  over the course of a year  you'll get that much radiation exposure anyway and there's not risk from that
2172,fibrosis and recurrence can occur if the surgery was done endoscopically a nerve conduction study with an inching study can help sort this out talk with your doctor
2173,effects of change sometimes when antidepressant medication is started or changed it can heighten symptoms or change severity of symptoms sometimes symptoms settle down and go away within a couple of weeks no matter what discuss side effects and the way medication effects you with prescribing doctor
2174,yes you probably have a viral syndrome steroids may make you feel better
2175,possible lupus have it evaluated
2176,2nd opinion without being able to see those radiographs or the swelling or your teeth  it is hard to give you a second opinion i suggest you see a specialist in your area (an endodontist or an oral surgeon) who can re-evaluate your mouth and determine what ails you
2177,needs evaluation yes  from what you describe this lump should be further evaluated by your primary care physician or by a surgeon don't delay!
2178,complex proper tx for has to be multi-faceted other medications  such as duloxetine and venlafaxine   can be tried  as well as certain anti-convulsants bio-feedback  yoga and other exercise   acupuncture  and therapeutic massage might help you should see a neurologist or pain mgmt  specialist with experience in this type of pain though not ideal  sometimes opiods for certain pts is an option
2179,definitely follow-up axillary swelling can be due to many causes  but this definitely needs to be investigated enlarged axillary lymph nodes can cause swelling in this area and with your family history of early age breast cancer  a mammogram would be reasonable i do not know what your doctor felt in the axilla or breast  but an axillary ultrasound as an initial test could show if there were enlarged nodes
2180,call pediatrician! your son has an rash and fever this sounds a lot like either chicken pox  measles has he also had the mmr vaccine? before you go to your doctor's office  please give them a call to make sure they're ready to keep him apart from other kids who may be there for other reasons the office may give him a mask to cover his mouth and nose as well  just in case
2181,no droop lip the nerve damage after a wisdom tooth is extracted is called a paraesthesia it could be temporary and healed after several months however it could be permanent it usually does not result in droopy lip
2182,fibula fracture generally speaking no displaced fractures can be casted for 4-6 weeks if the fracture is however noted to be unstable or in combination with other injuries that would render instability  surgery may be indicated
2183,no methotrexate  if felt to be the most efficacious therapy by a competent rheumatologist who will follow you carefully for side-effects and complications should be a reasonable choice this should be done with some degree of caution and there are other treatments for ra see rheumatologiist hope you feel better soon

2186,treat the source has the tooth been extracted? if not it needs to be after the source of the infection (ie tooth) is treated  there maybe some swelling continue on the antibiotics  hot moist compresses if cheek swelling does not subside  need to be seen again asap
2187,how long? it may be an upper respiratory infection not enough info to talk about cancer go see your physician
2188,? need more info what do your docs say?
2189,sprain/fracture/infe this could be several pathologies one a toe sprain from hyperflexion or extension(turf toe) another could be a fracture as long as the toe is not displaced a buddy splint will be fine lastly a soft tissue infection with a possible athletes foot skin disease hope this helps answer your question
2190,there there are many options available to treat eczema these include moisturizers (vanicream  cetaphil restoraderm  cerave to name a few)  topical steroids (both over-the-counter and prescription)  and calcinuerin inhibitors (pimecrolimus and tacrolimus) in general the mainstay of routine treatment should be with moisturizers and using as needed topical steroids there is potential for skin lightening and thinning of the skin with topical steroids if used for long-term therapy or with the use of potent topical steroids food allergy can be involved in some cases of moderate-severe eczema other strategies include soak and seal wraps/dressings  bleach baths and other hydrating options would recommend you see your local provider to find out more information about these it is also common for patients who have eczema to develop allergic rhinitis as well as asthma i think that it is important to have your primary care provider/dermatologist/allergist work together to help provide the best results possible
2191,ask why not ask the person who performed the biopsy how it was done?

2195,ankle this can be common as ligaments heal with scar tissue and are sometimes tight after healing  re-visit your treating physician and more radiographic studies may well be needed
2196,tmj sounds like tmj syndrome to me very often tmj patients suffer from tinnitus ear ringing anatomically the joint is very close to the ear canal sea payed by a very thin piece of bone so often people who have tmj issues also have ear symptoms as well need to get a comprehensive dental exam with someone trained in this area you can google the pankey institute and fine a dentist in your area
2197,hemorrhoid more like bright blood on toilet paper is more likely to be due to hemorrhoids than colon cancer however  even hemorrhoids can cause anemia and related health problems bleeding from any orifice is a good reason to consult your doctor
2198,return after 4 days on antibiotics you should have seen relief if the bacteria were susceptible to the rx time to return to the dentist  reevaluate cause and change the rx of antibiotics
2199,several factors yes or no depending on the bone fractured  the alignment of the bone(displaced or not)  the radiographic signs of healing  how much and how long weight bearing
2200,no why all of the scans? if all neg obviously a mammo not indicated the more important question is whether a lesion or mass is palpable in the breast next year have a mammo and if neg the next one is 2 yrs later  always looking for early changes as with microcalcification  not seen on pet
2201,u need examination there are many issue that require evaluation by your doctor asap at minimum you need a testicular exam and urine analysis
2202,symptoms undiagnosed it is good news that the mri looked normal that pretty much rules out ms it can be helpful to visit with a neurologist though  since the symptoms returned they handle symptoms like those that occur in ms and other kinds of conditions
2203,sinus surgery it sounds like you had chronic sinusitis and a deviated septum
2204,see a doctor you may have a viral infection please see your doctor
2205,see dentist if soft tissue abscess has formed  may need drainage procedure call dds  ask about oral surgery referral
2206,allergies likely sounds like fairly typical allergy symptoms a cold(uri) and allergy can be very similar  but a cold lasts 5-7 days and you feel more sick allergies last much longer  like for an entire season  or year round you don't feel quite as ill with allergies
2207,yes yes
2208,10 minutes typically oral surgeons can do this quickly and easily as they do it every day often instead of grafting they can place an implant in the socket which the process and reduces cost i schedule these surgeries for 10 minutes plus time for local anesthesia if the patient will be awake this includes the implant i do lots of them  close to 1000 per year so i may be a little faster than some
2209,dentist you are under a syndrome type of condition that requires to put you in immediate treatment your bite must be checked and mouth devise must be designed for you also muscle relaxation is necessary for relief
2210,possible if you had unprotected intercourse there is always a chance of pregnancy wait for your next period and then determine if a test is necessary

2215,heart the heart cath and leg circulation test examine blood flow through your vessels have you an echocardiogram as well?

2217,arthritis this may represent arthritis-loss of ecartilage could also be a tendonitis
2218,re-excise it must be completely excised with good margins
2219,mammo if there is any amount of breast tissue at all  generally a mammo can be performed
2220,depends this will require an evaluation by an allergist they would ask you many questions like: -what are your typical nasal allergy symptoms? -what did you eat? -how soon after eating did this happen? -how long did it last? -did you take anything to treat this  and did it work? how long did it take? -etc on the little info i get from the question  i'd be very suspicious of a food allergy
2221,infection arm pit lump could be either a cyst  hydradenitis or lymph node if it is a lymph node  it is least likely to be cancer in your age group it is most likely secondary to an upper extremity wound or infection
2222,typical healing this is quite typical after surgical extractions of wisdom teeth remember to follow the instruction that the oral  surgeon gave you use ice packs for the swelling  15 minutes on then 15 minutes off nutrition is important for healing  so soft diet  yogurt  cool soups  ensure  boost limit talking this can take several days to heal call surgeon if you have concerns  but this sounds normal

2226,see you doc it is possible you should discuss your concerns with your treating oncologist

2228,melanoma in general pathologists do an excellent job with an entire specimen please have it re-excised with an adequate margin if there is concern over the scar please see a board certified plastic surgeon for a consult regarding this issue the majority i my practice is devoted to the care of cancer patient and i will be sent patients frequently for consults of this nature and other reconstructive needs
2229,it's possible the longer you have been having episodes of drinkking enough to be drunk  the more likely you are to have alcohol withdrawal symptoms perhaps it is flu symptoms  but if these symptoms have occurred more than once after a binge  i suspect they are withdrawal symptoms

2231,more info needed did you get a head ct or mri when you were in the hospital? if these symptoms are new or if they are getting worse compared to when you were in the hospital  yes go back if any of the following: headache is constant  associated with nausea  vomiting  gets worse when you bend down  strain  cough or sneeze  go to the er immediately if you are not sure  err on the safe side and go back for checkup
2232,trismus there is no such thing as classic tmj  the same as there is no classic knee they both are anatomic names of joints more likely it is the transitory inflammation of the muscles of biting and opening (masseteric sling)  named trismus limit opening wide  ice on and off  take nsaid (advil etc)  moist heat  soft diet; then it very well may subside good luck!
2233,may be both? as another doctor has suggested  you may need a more detailed lung function with dlco to confirm the suggestive ct finding on the other hand  if your lung function has become nearly normal after asthma treatment and your sob has mostly gone  the likelihood of ild would be quite low
2234,tmj specialist start with a dentist and then see if he/she will need to refer you to a tmj/tmd specialist or possibly another professional

2238,wateriness the watery eyes are not related to the prior cataract surgery dry eye is very common i would try artificial tears frequently during the day  ointment at night  warm compresses 1-2 times a day  and omega-3 fatty acid supplements if no improvement  see an eye doctor

2255,meniscus is cartilage in the knee joint there is a medial and a lateral meniscus they sit side by side ligaments hold everything together i don't know whats going on in your knee  but if it locks up when bent and hurts a lot its probably a problem with the meniscus ligaments can tear there is also the possibility of a small tibial plateau fracture i'd find out and get the proper treatment

2258,how long? if the drug is nor working at all after a couple of days  it is time to change the antibiotic sometimes a culture can be taken to identify the bacteria involved this is rarely necessary
2259,wisdom teeth ? wisdom teeth treatment plans vary considerably if these teeth are erupted in a normal manner; i'd recommend not touching them however  if they erupt outwardly (toward the check) or inwardly ( toward the tongue) consider removing them if decay is found on these teeth  they often develop further decay after fillings are placed  and would warrant extraction

2261,don't rush surgery a cold nodule on a nuclear scan could merely be a colloid cyst which is very unlikely to be of any concern thyroid ultrasound done before and during a needle biopsy will further characterize the nodule if the nodule is solid then a needle biopsy will help guide any further treatment surgery on the thyroid is not without risk and should be undertaken only for a good reason
2262,nose probably viral but with the green phlegm  there is probably a bacterial component with your history of asthma  best to see your primary and decide if you need to be on antibiotics
2263,yes this is done routinely in people who have prosthetic heart valves or joints prior to any dental care i am going to assume that you have neither  so why is s/he asking you to take them it could be for the same reasons  to help prevent bacterial endocarditis  or bacteremia from the procedure
2264,see below it could be very well be discuss with doctor the ct finding and whether you need to see pain management for injections or neurosurgery

2336,fibroscan yes  generally a reasonably diagnostic tool
2337,maybe pet/ct scan is a very sensitive test and may very well find additional sites of disease however  its sensitivity varies depending on the cancer histology and size of tumors unfortunately stage 4 means that the disease is advance and metastatic finding additional sites of disease may not significantly change the treatment plan and therefore may not be of additional help

2393,take claritin since u have no fever   i think it is allergies
2394,toothaches toothaches are a difficult problem and there can be many causes for them without having met you i can only guess as to what is going on  but i would consider asking your dentist for a referral to see an endodontist for a consultation endodontists specialize in the nerve of the teeth and from what you're describing it sounds as though your nerve is irritated  dying or is already dead sometimes after having dental work done (such as getting a crown placed) the nerve can be irritated and just needs time to relax and go back to normal sometimes though  the nerve can be permantently damaged to no fault of the dentist (it can just happen sometimes) and will need a root canal if your gums are inflammed  then there's probably truth to what your dentist said about getting the gums cut back as the inflammation will usually not resolve itself and will only lead to more destruction in the mouth unless it's corrected by the minor surgery gum sensitivity typically won't lead to the nerve pain you're describing however  so this tooth might have more than one issue going on with it best of luck
2395,multiple symptoms no doubt you could be pregnant even though you're breastfeeding it doesn't confer 100% protection however  if pregnancy test is negative and say a repeat one in 2 weeks is negative again  there should be another reason explaining these symptoms

2400,cancer? tender lymph nodes are usually due to infection see your doctor they would likely put you on antibiotics and see you again in a couple weeks if nodes still enlarged they may suggest an fna (fine needle aspiration) where a small needle is used to collect cells that are submitted to a pathologist for an examination
2401,not yet dense breasts often decrease the effectiveness of mammogram if there is any concern about the mammogram you could consider asking for an mri to be performed of the breasts- this may add additional information in helping to determine if there is anything to be concerned about

2404,neurologist  mri first  don't panic uneven pupils  aka anisocoria  are often due to a benign condition like migraines which would also explain the eye pain and headaches however  more serious causes like multiple sclerosis and brain tumors are possible you should see a neurologist who will likely order an mri of the brain as part of a complete evaluation
2405,see details your current levels of glucose and a1c are normal it is unlikely your current symptoms are related to any prediabetic condition
2406,sleep apnea  snoring several possibilities: some people only snore if they sleep on their back  so try avoiding that losing weight see an ear nose & throat specialist to evaluate your tonsils  adenoids and sinus have an overnight sleep study to evaluate for sleep apnea and wear a cpap or wear a custom made dental device that holds your jaw forward while you sleep thereby increasing the airway
2407,any doctor any doctor can order a holter monitor it takes special training to interpret the results  however
2408,huh you need a mammogram if you or your doctor feels a lump in your breasts  or you are over 40 if you have a 1st degree relative such as mother or sister with breast cancer  you can choose to start your mammograms when you are 10 years younger than the age your relative was diagnosed or at age 40  whatever comes first i once had a dream i could fly  so should i jump off the grand canyon?

2416,check it out any symptoms of infectin would check it out with your doc
2417,symptoms worse? any time your symptoms become worse than they were before  is a good time to seek another evaluation findings that were subtle on the 1st exam  may be more evident when your symptoms increase or change sometimes  blood clots can start in your abdomen before they show up in your legs  so it's worth getting another ultrasound to be sure
2418,see md if you have sleep apnea you need to be evaluated dont pay any attention to the neurotransmitter issue

2420,you you have symptoms which are classic for gallstone disease and have been diagnosed with gallstones with what i assume was an ultrasound of the abdomen those are the only indications you need for surgery i would not wait until you have further symptoms or your symptoms worsen each time you have a gallbladder attack  you experience some chronic inflammation the more attacks you have  the more difficult it will make your surgery i would not waste any time
2421,meniscus tear a torn meniscus can often cause intermittent symptoms meniscus tears usually do not heal so it is likely that your meniscus is still causing you problems

2821,yes but likely lyme! it's possible  but chronic lyme can cause symptoms identical to ms just because you were treated for chronic lyme does not mean it has been eradicated; many lyme specialists feel chronic lyme is nearly impossible to cure & many if not most cases of ms are caused by lyme this is controversial  but since you have lyme it is much more likely to be causing your symptoms than ms see my comment:

2836,sure snoring is the sound of turbulent airflow things that may help in reducing decibels or reducing overall snoring may be body position change (like avoiding sleeping on back)  this could involve pillows or other positioners also improvement in nasal congestion/narrowing i recommend a lot of sinus rinses (no medication just ph balanced salt solutions) or nasal sprays to help with congestion

2842,lesser rx possible the answers by drs fung and hoepfner are correct for standard of care however  a partial colectomy with sampling of at least 10 nodes could be considered if you are willing to have intensive screening colonoscopy and resection of new adenomas improved control of the inflammatory disease might decrease the risk of cancer in the remaining colon  but poor control in the past led to colectomy rx
2843,yeast vs allergy it sounds like that lubricant did not agree with you you should see a doctor  pcp or urgent care  for complete evaluation and treatment in the meantime  avoid sex and any lubricants or condoms

2852,cta score? we don't report a score with a coronary artery cta cac (coronary artery calcium) score is done with ct but without iv contrast the nonconrast study looks at calcified plaque and is useful for risk stratification but would not detect non calcified plaque as a cta would partial anomalous pulmonary venous return is an extra cardiac left to right shunt and could eventually lead to pulm htn

2884,thanks thanks for your question! after having liquid nitrogen treatment for plantar warts  it is not unusual to have some mild redness around the treatment area this is called reactive erythema and is a sign of the inflammation around the area that was treated however  redness that is warm and/or painful  or that spreads or that drains pus  can be a sign of cellulitis - a bacterial infection of the skin it can be difficult for patients to tell the difference sometimes i would recommend seeing your doctor right away to determine if antibiotics are needed if it is cellulitis  the most common bacteria that cause infection in this area are staphylococcus and streptococcus you may have heard of a bacteria that is more difficult to treat with antibiotics called methicillin resistent staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) there are also other bacteria that can cause the infection but these are the most common cephalexin is a common choice for skin infections but would likely not be effective for mrsa after examining your foot  your doctor can make an educated decision regarding which antibiotic is right for you  taking into account which medications you are already taking  your allergies  and your examination never take antibiotics unless they are prescribed by a medical professional for your specific problem it can be dangerous to take leftover medications from a previous infection or to purchase antibiotics on the internet at best  it can confuse the picture for your doctor if a wound culture is needed i wish you the best!

2889,swelling while i agree with the other doc's   you said your surgery was in 2012 that is 16 months ago your swelling may not go away as it may be something called brawny edema and is more fibrous in nature see your surgeon and good luck

2891,takes time it can take up to two weeks for you to receive all of your results give it some time in the mean time if you're concerned about and std  use condoms when you're having sex and if any of your tests come back positive  it's your responsibility to let all of your sexual contacts know

2957,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs/carries things too big to go into the arteries/veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph for anything bad like bacteria/viruses/cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well
