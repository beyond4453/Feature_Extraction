1430,i broke my left elbow in a bicycling accident in may  i was referred to dr henley by the washington regional er staff  his staff got me in for an apt very quickly and i had surgery apx a week later  dr henley has a great bedside manner and makes sure you understand what the problem is and how he is going to fix it  i turn 40 this year and this is my 1st broken bone and being the active person i am thought this was going to be a breeze  i would waltz out of surgerydo a little therapyand all would be better  poor dr henleythe surgery went well but scar tissue aggressively  set up in my elbow and no matter how hard i worked in therapy and at home i could not get my elbow to bend  two things happened at that point that i feel really turned my whole situation arounddr henley recommended a manipulation procedure where you go to the outpatient center they put you to sleep and he bends your arm and breaks up the scar tissue  then my therapist cindy wonderful person recommended a static pro  after an injury in october 2011  which resulted in tendonitis in my elbow  i experienced severe pain that limited my activities  my family enjoys many outdoor activities  and i have not been able to participate since this injury  my first treating physician had me do pt and a steroid injection  the steroid injection worked great for about a week  but the pain returned  he then referred me to dr henley for a prp platelet rich plasma injection  which was done on 6 11 12  if you are not familiar with this procedure  as i was not  and you have tendonitis  you should do some research  it is so simple  and there is little to no pain during the procedure  it is very sore for about 48 hours afterwards  compared to the pain i have been experiencing for months  it was nothing  so far i have been amazed at the results  my elbow is still slightly tender to the touch  and i do have to stretch it out in the morning after it has been immobile during the night  but it is so much better  i followed up with dr h  ui was sent to dr henley by my family doctor for an infected cat bite not responding to antibiotics i was seen by dr henley promptly and he wasted no time in determining that my fingers condition was serious and needed immediate attention he explained what was going on and the possible outcomes he then sent me straight to the hospital saying he would meet me there the hospital staff were very friendly and professional and familiar with dr henley i was not kept waiting long for dr henleys arrival  dr henley was very cheerful when he arrived and checked in on me which made me feel good my son and daughterinlaw were very happy with how dr henley related how the surgery went  what he had done  how long i would be in recovery  and how long before i could go back to work he showed concern for me  which they were very pleased with he exhibited an excellent bedside manner when he saw me in the hospital and answered all my questions all my follow up visits went well with all my questions answered dr  udr henley took his time to explain to me what he had found he also informed me that it wasnt imperative that i immediately schedule surgery that made me feel very comfortable that he wasnt pushing me to have surgery i chose to go ahead and schedule the surgery just to get it out of the way  but didnt feel pushed to do so dr henley was also very punctual i appreciate that i was able to get in to see him pretty close to the time that i was scheduled too many times i have sat in a doctors office waiting for hours after my originally scheduled appointment i appreciate the respect he had for my time although i know that there are instances when a doctor may be running behind due to unforeseen circumstances  it is really appreciated that this is the exception rather than the rule i highly recommend dr henley you will leave your appointment understanding exactly what your issue is  whether or not it is critical that surgery be scheduled immediately or if it can it wait  and having a great feeling tha  ui had suffered with both hands from athritis and bone spurs for the past 5 years and it got to be pain 24 7  i was at a  point where i could not enjoy crocheting or doing other thing i enjoyed i looked on the internet and read dr henleys profile and really liked what i read i set up to see him and after xray he new right off what the problem was  i  tried the cortisone shot  first thinking that would help than i had to wait for 6 weeks before he could do surgery wish i would have done surgery from the start i had my left hand done on sept 14  2011 everything went great wore cast for 2 weeks than went to brace for 6 weeks  i had my right one done on nov 23  2011  i went back to dr henley on jan 12  2012 and he took my last brace off  re xrayed it everyting looked great so now i am free and 2 handed again what a blessing my hands no longer hurt  left one is great and right one getting stronger everyday still alittle tender but so much better  i can now crochet again i would highly recommend  after 7 years of pain  arthritis medicines and splinting  i told my primary care physician i had had enough  he referred me to dr henley  i visited him in early 2010 and he did some xrays and testing and told me i had carpal tunnel in my right hand and both thumb joints had deteriorated from degenerative arthritis  he explained my options  one of which was a series of steroid injections  i tried that without success  finally in february 2010 i was ready for surgery  he did carpal tunnel repair and rebuilt my thumb joint on my right hand  i returned to him in september 2010 and he rebuilt my left thumb joint  before my surgeries  i was pretty much in constant pain  getting dressed was painful  opening a jar was out of the question  i spent several months in therapy cindy is the best and am happy and pleased to say  i feel better than i have in years and find myself wondering why i waited so long  my hands are strong and just like new  i can work in my garden  do housework  and even lift weig

3308,i worked with one of his colleagues  only good things to say about this unique practice
3309,i broke my left elbow in a bicycling accident in may  i was referred to dr henley by the washington regional er staff  his staff got me in for an apt very quickly and i had surgery apx a week later  dr henley has a great bedside manner and makes sure you understand what the problem is and how he is going to fix it  i turn 40 this year and this is my 1st broken bone and being the active person i am thought this was going to be a breeze  i would waltz out of surgerydo a little therapyand all would be better  poor dr henleythe surgery went well but scar tissue aggressively  set up in my elbow and no matter how hard i worked in therapy and at home i could not get my elbow to bend  two things happened at that point that i feel really turned my whole situation arounddr henley recommended a manipulation procedure where you go to the outpatient center they put you to sleep and he bends your arm and breaks up the scar tissue  then my therapist cindy wonderful person recommended a static pro  after an injury in october 2011  which resulted in tendonitis in my elbow  i experienced severe pain that limited my activities  my family enjoys many outdoor activities  and i have not been able to participate since this injury  my first treating physician had me do pt and a steroid injection  the steroid injection worked great for about a week  but the pain returned  he then referred me to dr henley for a prp platelet rich plasma injection  which was done on 6 11 12  if you are not familiar with this procedure  as i was not  and you have tendonitis  you should do some research  it is so simple  and there is little to no pain during the procedure  it is very sore for about 48 hours afterwards  compared to the pain i have been experiencing for months  it was nothing  so far i have been amazed at the results  my elbow is still slightly tender to the touch  and i do have to stretch it out in the morning after it has been immobile during the night  but it is so much better  i followed up with dr h  ui was sent to dr henley by my family doctor for an infected cat bite not responding to antibiotics i was seen by dr henley promptly and he wasted no time in determining that my fingers condition was serious and needed immediate attention he explained what was going on and the possible outcomes he then sent me straight to the hospital saying he would meet me there the hospital staff were very friendly and professional and familiar with dr henley i was not kept waiting long for dr henleys arrival  dr henley was very cheerful when he arrived and checked in on me which made me feel good my son and daughterinlaw were very happy with how dr henley related how the surgery went  what he had done  how long i would be in recovery  and how long before i could go back to work he showed concern for me  which they were very pleased with he exhibited an excellent bedside manner when he saw me in the hospital and answered all my questions all my follow up visits went well with all my questions answered dr  udr henley took his time to explain to me what he had found he also informed me that it wasnt imperative that i immediately schedule surgery that made me feel very comfortable that he wasnt pushing me to have surgery i chose to go ahead and schedule the surgery just to get it out of the way  but didnt feel pushed to do so dr henley was also very punctual i appreciate that i was able to get in to see him pretty close to the time that i was scheduled too many times i have sat in a doctors office waiting for hours after my originally scheduled appointment i appreciate the respect he had for my time although i know that there are instances when a doctor may be running behind due to unforeseen circumstances  it is really appreciated that this is the exception rather than the rule i highly recommend dr henley you will leave your appointment understanding exactly what your issue is  whether or not it is critical that surgery be scheduled immediately or if it can it wait  and having a great feeling tha  ui had suffered with both hands from athritis and bone spurs for the past 5 years and it got to be pain 24 7  i was at a  point where i could not enjoy crocheting or doing other thing i enjoyed i looked on the internet and read dr henleys profile and really liked what i read i set up to see him and after xray he new right off what the problem was  i  tried the cortisone shot  first thinking that would help than i had to wait for 6 weeks before he could do surgery wish i would have done surgery from the start i had my left hand done on sept 14  2011 everything went great wore cast for 2 weeks than went to brace for 6 weeks  i had my right one done on nov 23  2011  i went back to dr henley on jan 12  2012 and he took my last brace off  re xrayed it everyting looked great so now i am free and 2 handed again what a blessing my hands no longer hurt  left one is great and right one getting stronger everyday still alittle tender but so much better  i can now crochet again i would highly recommend  after 7 years of pain  arthritis medicines and splinting  i told my primary care physician i had had enough  he referred me to dr henley  i visited him in early 2010 and he did some xrays and testing and told me i had carpal tunnel in my right hand and both thumb joints had deteriorated from degenerative arthritis  he explained my options  one of which was a series of steroid injections  i tried that without success  finally in february 2010 i was ready for surgery  he did carpal tunnel repair and rebuilt my thumb joint on my right hand  i returned to him in september 2010 and he rebuilt my left thumb joint  before my surgeries  i was pretty much in constant pain  getting dressed was painful  opening a jar was out of the question  i spent several months in therapy cindy is the best and am happy and pleased to say  i feel better than i have in years and find myself wondering why i waited so long  my hands are strong and just like new  i can work in my garden  do housework  and even lift weig
