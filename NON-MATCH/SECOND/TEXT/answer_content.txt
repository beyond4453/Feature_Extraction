280,good but hard ? it is not wrong for her to get chemo insofar as she understands that chemo will at best slow down disease and maybe improve some symptoms at the cost of side effects she and her oncologist have to be honest with each other and use common sense regarding when to stop it is not wrong to forego chemo now and go hospice either it is ultimately her call  back her choice please

282,if doctor calls if you have new breast masses  you should have the mammogram +/- breast ultrasounds asap ask your physician to call the mammogram center to see if s/he can get you in sooner also  ask the mammography unit to put you on their wait lists in case any one cancels i would also recommend seeing a breast surgeon for evaluation as well
283,sinus i recommend both!

287,shortness of breath not due to lack of oxygen brain stem drive to ? breathing rate driven by ph  co2 + anxiety/fears anticipating need to move ?es in co2 drives ?ed respiratory rate rate goes down with ?ed co2 production; brain nearly totally ignores o2  reason giving people o2 does not alter their depth/rate of breathing look this up if you exercise competitively with others  your heart & lungs are ok
288,6 years? you've really had this for 6 years? any infection or allergy should have cleared up by now see a dermatologist and find out what this is! good luck!
289,ct is better if the ct either found nothing in the lungs (meaning the chest xray findings were overlapping structures or outside the lungs) or what was found was clearly benign on the ct scan  then there is nothing to worry about this assumes a high quality ct scan read by a competent radiologist
290,probably croup caused by parainfluenza it worsens each day peaking on the 3rd day then steadily improving cold makes it better in warm climates breathing in freezer air helps if cold outside at night  when always worse  bundle up and go outside it is usually worse in winter but does happen in simmer too severe trouble breathing as in young infants can warrant an er trip
291,translation your thyroid gland is enlarged (that's what a goiter is) on ultrasound  some areas of your thyroid appear darker than others (that is heterogenous) there are nodules seen  but none is obviously larger than the others (this is what suggestive of a multinodular goiter means) if your thyroid is large enough that it's causing you symptoms  than see a surgeon about having it removed
292,can't tell the test you stated above is a thyroid ultrasound it is not a scan you can't tell if something is hot or cold definitively on a thyroid ultrasound you need a thyroid scan (using radioactive iodine) to know if something is hot or cold if your tsh was normal  you probably didn't have a scan for a nodule that small (3 mm)
293,usually low blood pressure usually is independent of anemia if you have significant anemia then you can have low bp so there are many factors involved the degree of anemia  history of hypertension amount of protein in your blood system i usually do not see high bp with anemia but it can happen
294,steroid cream on the skin you can use 1% hydrocortisone cream (otc) you could also take an antihistamine for both allergy and itch relief good luck!
295,food allergies the skin test is much more sensitive than the blood test  you should eliminate milk and soy also try to stay gluten free wholeapproachcom and gutbliss dietcom rember allergies develop over time and exposure so keep a food diary and make sure to rotate food daily if symptoms persist see an allergist for serum to start immunotherapy
296,yes the allergens in fish and seafood are flesh or meat proteins the vitamin d in milk is not derived from fish

298,not always no but during any infection or allergies you can feel congested

300,can't say the numbness is usually caused by an injury or an irritation to the nerve bundles or sheath  you should ask your dentist how close to the nerve was your tooth sometime the numbness can be transient and can last up to a year  in rare cases where the nerve was badly damaged or severed before or during the surgery that the numbness becomes permanent
301,see your doctor you may have an infection or an allergic reaction it is important to be evaluated symptoms alone cannot diagnose your problem
302,lasik if stable if your prescription has not changed much in last 1-2 years  then you should do well with lasik  as long as you have a through eye exam and computerized measurements of your corneal curvature and thickness  and all is normal preferably the exam should be done and all testing reviewed by the ophthalmologist / eye surgeon who will perform the procedure make sure to get all your questions answered

304,jaw pain you refer to previous infection with your wisdom tooth even though it seems fine  your jaw pain could reflect a problem with that wisdom tooth  such as a cyst or an infection in the jaw bone i would recommend you see an oral and maxillofacial surgeon in consultation to determine what the problem is and what would be in your best interest good luck!
305,to to add to dr dyro's answer  ms can affect the spinal cord as well as the brain  so if a brain mri was not conclusive but a spinal cord mri was not done  ms has certainly not been excluded as to whether autonomic neuropathy can be fatal  it is unusual but can happen  if low blood pressure affects the heart or brain  causing loss of consciousness which can then cause serious trauma depending on when it happens if you have syncope and fall you could injure yourself substantially usually the various manifestations of peripheral or autonomic neuropathy can be treated symptomatically with some benefit but the underlying disease process is often not treatable with current knowledge and technology
306,no symptom no treat 25-50% women develop benign uterine fibroid (muscle) tumors if you don't have symptoms (heavy periods  pain) then no intervention is needed if you do then many options exist to help improve them: myomectomy  hysterectomy (laparoscopic)  uterine artery ablation  and hysteroscopic myomectomy

308,not necessarily chest xray shows one parameter of lung abnormality pulmonary function tests determine whether copd is causing problem air trapping is not specific and can be seen in patients with asthma and other pulmonary diseases
309,possibly stress & anxiety--in general & in association with hormonal changes--can produce those symptoms it's usually most helpful to get a rhythm tracing during an attack  so your doctor may order a 24-hour holter monitor to try to catch one it can also help your doctor to know the hr during an episode  so i would recommend measuring your hr (counting the beats in a minute) during the next few attacks
310,return to doctor possible referred pain from a tooth in lower arch  the lower arch has a branch of the trigeminal nerve that goes up the side of the jaw in front of the ear return to dentist to be revaluated

312,anxiety yes it can but rule out medical causes too
313,fluid the fluid in the middle ear space is not in itself dangerous the question is is it creating difficulty for your child (are the infections hard to treat? is he complaining of pain or pressure all the time? ) in good studies the long term consequences of persistent fluid is negligible having said that putting a tube in will relieve the fluid but requires anesthesia and is not entirely without risk
314,mammograms are unable to diagnose cysts cysts are of the same x-ray density as solid soft tissue on mammo a cyst will look like a round mass on mammo  but ultrasound can usually easily distinguish cyst from solid cysts can come and go  and get bigger or smaller no way to predict what they will do fortunately  they are benign
315,pimple such changes can occur in many different parts of the body of course  there are many other possibilities (eg inflammed lymph nodes) bartholin's gland cysts (although not in the classic location) is yet another possibility sitz baths (soaking the perineum in a shallow pan/bucket of warm water with a touch of epsom salt for about five minutes daily) can sometimes decrease any symptoms
316,mrsa infection the chances of transferring mrsa to your boyfriend are decreased if you have been on the appropriate antibiotic for at least 24 hours if there is still discharge from the wound then it may still be possible to transfer the infection you should take caution and keep the infected area well covered until the area is dry without discharge you should continue the medication as directed

323,not likely if your jeans are just tight in one part of the leg acting like a tourniquet it could theoretically cause stasis or slowing of flow which may predispose to dvt how ever if it is uniformly tight like jeans most likely are  it will compress all the veins aiding in venous return some patients with venous disease are actually given compression stockings to help venous return
324,treatment plan what exactly is the treatment plan for this tooth? is the tooth going to be extracted or is it going to be saved with root canal therapy  a post  and a crown? if the tooth is to be saved  then root canal therapy may need to be immediately started to remove the toxins leaching into the bone an extraction can be performed if the infection is under control antibiotics alone may not be the answer
325,als amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or lou gehrig's disease is a degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons the diagnosis is made with an emg and additional tests may include a lumbar puncture and an mr i of the brain and spinal cord a second opinion with a neurologist will provide you some reassurance

334,could be either those symptoms actually can go with either a bacterial or viral infection strep throat is a possible bacterial cause of those symptoms there could be several viruses causing this as well someone with mild symptoms could start with supportive care with fever reducer  fluids  and rest if symptoms worsened or did not improve  one should be examined and have a strep test done

344,most brain mris will encompass some or all of the paranasal sinuses  albeit not in optimal detail so really the particular mri would need to be individually assessed to determine whether it is adequate to rule out a sinus mass the best way to image the sinuses is with a ct or mri specifically tailored for that purpose
345,response yes  in the past  prior to imaging advances  hot bath test was utilized to exacerbate patient symptoms to confirm diagnosis  but no longer used as was often false positive  and mri supplanted occasional ms patients seem to do better in warmer environments  and some even do worse in cold weather thus  your responses are not indicative of definitive diagnosis
346,probably not although lung cancer can occur in someone in their early 30's  it is pretty unusual a chest ct is a good test at evaluating the lungs for lung cancer if it is normal  then it is not lung cancer but  as i'm sure you already know  you should stop smoking if you keep smoking  there's a good chance of developing cancer in the future as well as heart and blood vessel disease 1800 quit now

674,probably yes! typically a 7 inch (18 cm) mass in the breast would require surgical removal although a benign biopsy result is very comforting  when a mass is so large  it is impossible to evaluate the entire lesion for cancer without removal cancer may occupy part of a large mass and not involve other parts
675,unlikely ibs-type symptoms in mid-twenties female unlikely cancer more likely recurrence of ibs see a gastroenterologist for understanding keep in mind a mutual association of fibromyalgia & joint hypermobility syndrome in females with ibs imo  pelvic joint disorders often complicitous in all these disorders osteopath  physiatrist  & physical therapist best specialists to evaluate if fever go now

698,possible break this could be a stress fracture to the heel or ankle bone you need to get an xray from your podiatrist to determine if this is the reason other causes are tendonitis to the area  bursitis of the achilles tendon to name a few if you are a serious runner  than you need to have a good sports podiatrist that can help you with this and get you back running quickly

707,see an ob/gyn get examined and diagnosed and treated if necessary cannot diagnose over internet
708,radiculopathy! you are probably describing an s1nerve root compression  although a l5 is possible by your imprecise description pain is a paradoxical good sign  since pressure on the nerve is more minimal gravity traction may help  as might a steroid dose pack but if neither work  your next date will be a spine surgeon i always get an emg before imaging the spine

753,salivary nodes these bumps may be swollen salivary glands that can get blocked by calcium deposits and then become infected easily treated with augmentin  but if infection returns i would seek attention from an ent to see if the salivary duct is blocked if this a lymph node infection  a biopsy is might be needed to determine the source of infection

758,an an ultrasound can suggest what it is bit is not definitive an ultrasound looks at fluid changes so for a cyst it is good to see the transition from the awl of the cyst to the inside fluid layer stll where it is can also influence the ultrasounds ability to discern detail ie behind a bone the sound waves may not get through as well while the tech may give someone preliminary info one really needs to wait for the formal report and for the ordering physician to review it and make sur the findings correspond and are relevant to the problem this last reason is why a lot of physicians/surgeons are starting to do their own musculoskeletal ultrasound in their own office setting the ability for a surgeon who knows the anatomy primarily to see structures and do a relevant physical exam at the same time becomes of great value
759,yes  & many other possibilities ?d3  calcitriol  1  25-dihydroxyvitamin d3  long assoc with ca+2 absorption & bone strength more recently with ?heart muscle strength  ?susceptibility to infections  ?depression  etc at the same time  we are complex mind-over-matter creatures  issues complex  lots of unknowns  optimal level unknown  esp at single individual level suggest supplement d3 to > 40 & check other issue

771,possible pregnancy it's always possible the best thing to do is run a home urine pregnancy test they are very accurate and turn positive 10-14 days after having sex if it's negative  repeat it in 7 days if still negative  you're not pregnant from that encounter

1440,immune workup repeated staph infections may be due to an immune deficiency some of the cells involved in fighting infection may carry a defect that makes him more prone to staph i would suggest speaking with you pediatrician about this possibility some of the conditions include cgd prmg pediatric resp fax 858 259 9689 for review of records and ?s i hope that this helps
1441,ct not sensitive ct scan is a useful tool for pre operative evaluation and postoperative surveillance  however most colon cances would not be detectable by standard cat scan unless they were very large  or had obvious spread to the liver a colonoscopy is the most sensitive screening test ct colonoscopy can be almost as sensitive as colonoscopy  but is a specialized test and requires the same prep as a colonoscop
