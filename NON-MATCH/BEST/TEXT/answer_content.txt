2941,something of concern we get questions about a bruise all the time those are not this much of an issue: generalized bruising weight loss the other symptoms are hard to characterize body aches weakness mild dizzy since very common and usually from minor things the degree of both of the concerning symptoms i cannot tell without an exam for your situation but deep bloody bruising worse but exam tests regardles
2942,recurrent problem the collapsed lung is called a spontaneous pneumothorax if it happens without prior trauma if he has anatomical blebs in his lung or his doctors feel he is at high risk for recurrence they may do a bleb resection and or a pleurodesis which is deliberate scarring to force the lung to adhere to the chest wall so it cant collapse again as is prone to happen in some people

2945,cant tell without an examination of your teeth and sinuses  it is impossible to say for sure multiple upper teeth hurting at once would suggest sinus irritation as a cause  but if its lower teeth the cause might be clenching grinding ofcourse  decay of the teeth could also cause your complaint the only way to know is for you to have yore tooth looked at

2950,yes  it can of course overstudying and undersleeping can lead to headache  nervousness  and dizziness anxiety makes the sleeplessness worse  and vice versa you also need to make sure not to use stimulants caffeine  amphetamines  etc because they will worsen your state establish regular sleep wake times even on weekends exercise  even just a walk around the block see doctor if symptoms persist
2951,yes impacted 3rd molars very often work their way into the mouth  and many just stay put without a special image called a panoramic or panorex  the dentist has no way of assessing the condition of the roots many times there exist pathologies adjacent to and because of these teeth  with no symptoms at all waiting until you feel pain is too late in my opinion  and would be supervised neglect
