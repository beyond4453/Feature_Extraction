503,abcds remember your abcds when thinking of melanoma look for moles with asymmetry boarders that are irregular color differences within the same mole diameter greater than 6mm also any new mole or old that starts to itch  bleed or ulcerate should be of concern another rule is the ugly duckling rule which refers to a mole that looks distantly different from the others on your body

1293,toothaches toothaches are a difficult problem and there can be many causes for them without having met you i can only guess as to what is going on  but i would consider asking your dentist for a referral to see an endodontist for a consultation endodontists specialize in the nerve of the teeth and from what yore describing it sounds as though your nerve is irritated  dying or is already dead sometimes after having dental work done such as getting a crown placed the nerve can be irritated and just needs time to relax and go back to normal sometimes though  the nerve can be permantently damaged to no fault of the dentist it can just happen sometimes and will need a root canal if your gums are inflammed  then theres probably truth to what your dentist said about getting the gums cut back as the inflammation will usually not resolve itself and will only lead to more destruction in the mouth unless its corrected by the minor surgery gum sensitivity typically wont lead to the nerve pain yore describing however  so this tooth might have more than one issue going on with it best of luck
1294,i i applaud your desire to have information before you arrive to the appointment a few questions would be helpful did you ever have symptoms in the past any involvement of your eyes was the positive csf oligoclonal bands or elevated igg index the information you presented best fits with a monsymptomatic presentation as defined by the mcdonalds criteria which was designed to define those individuals who are likely to develop ms to secure the diagnosis you would need another clinical event or a change in your mri after 3 months they will probably want further testing including veps visual evoked potentials or oct optical coherence tomography the lab evaluation will include an ana  b12  folate  esr  vitamin d panel and routine labs they may also want a mri of the thoracic spine if the exam suggests spinal cord involvement good luck and well wishes

1307,dermatological dermatological conditions are always difficult to diagnose without seeing them if they are new and itchy  then conditions such as hives should be considered if they are flat and scaly  a viral rash like pityriasis could be considered  these are usually reddish however if they have a clear vesicle bubble on top  then chicken pox should be considered consulting a physician for a rash on a child is always a good idea  so the best advice would be to have her doctor take a look at that
1308,part of the process the process of dental bonding is a general procedure by which fillings  crowns  veneers  orthodontic brackets can be connected to teeth it is a biochemical process by which these materials literally become chemically bonded to the tooth structure the process is technique sensitive and varies slightly for each type of procedure  but it is very often used with fillings  very successful

2095,severity in general  bone grafting pain from filling a defect in bone is less than the pain from removal of a bony impacted wisdom tooth  but more than removal of a fully erupted wisdom tooth we do a lot of bone grafting and people tend to do quite well your doctor can control your discomfort with medication  but unfortunately none of us can take the pain completely out of a surgical procedure

2100,have it evaluated swelling may last a long time following a foot or ankle injury an xray can show if there is an underlying fracture the xrays may be falsely negative initially in cases of small stress fractures you may have a soft tissue injury if it is just a sprain and may have damaged the muscle  tendon  or ligaments in the area have it evaluated by a professional and get the appropriate treatment

2114,perhaps although tooth decay cannot occur without exposure to oral bacteria  emergence of the wisdom tooth is a slow process  and yours may have broken the surface some time before you became aware of that fact therefore  although it is uncommon for wisdom teeth to develop decay prior to their eruption  they can have cavities anytime after their embryonic follicle becomes opened to the oral environment
2115,yes unless you are very young in your twenties with very shortterm symptoms  this is normal for most patients  they have some relief of numbness right after surgery and a lot of relief of nighttime pain numbness in the very tips of the fingers is the last thing to get better depending on how long its gone on and how severe the symptoms have been  this may take a few months
2116,have it evaluated twisting ones’ ankle can lead to soft tissue or bony injuries often times  this may result in ligament or tendon injuries which may lead to ankle bruising  swelling  pain  and possibly instability an xray of the foot and ankle will be able to assist in differentiating a sprain form a fracture you may need and mri to diagnose various cartilaginous or soft tissue injuries have it evaluated

2120,dependent on goals if you wish to regain function of the nerve i agree with dr m that seeing a surgeon capable of doing nerve repairs is the best idea repositioning of your foot and ankle may be accomplished by an orthopedic surgeon through fusions or tendon tethering procedures if you are dealing with ulceration caused by the lack of sensation in your foot then you may want to see a dpm or wound care specialist
2121,can be other things such as arthritis at th base of the thumb  or irritation from prolonged dependency on splints may be suspect as well
2122,short lived usually only a day or two   you may experience some discomfort requiring an otc medication for up to a week its really not that bad

2124,another stress do you smoke has the pain changed in any nature you may benifit from another stress test talk to your pcp
2125, depression when patients have many unrelated simultaneous symptoms  the possibility of depression must be considered if not present  additional workup is needed since your description does not fit a single disease entity see your regular doctor for further evaluation
2126,methadone for pain methadone can be useful for persistent pain but it may be more dangerous than vicodin 40 mgm hydrocodone is not a very large dose methadone can decrease tolerance the bodys need for more pain meds to achieve the same result and so it must be used carefully when switching from another opioid it can interfere with the electrical conduction in your heart and produce a fatal arrhythmia
2127,ice chips i would try a dental hotline in area if you have one if not  rub some ice chips over the area and tylenol or some antiinflammatory if can take it and if you cannot get into a dentist soon
2128,no heart attacks are typically a result of platelets sticking together and blocking an artery in the heart aspirin blocks the platelets ability to stick together decreasing the chance that a blockage heart attack will occur for this reason  aspirin is one of the most effective medicines ever discovered for the prevention of heart attacks neither tylenol or ibuprofen has this effect
2129,probably not directl mitral valve prolapse is a description of how the mitral valve closes it can be associated with a leaking mitral valve if the leak is large enough it can cause parts of the heart to expand and dilate this can predispose you to develop all sorts of rhythm issues but most who have prolapse dont develop svts because most do not have any significant leak

2142,swelling swelling in the legs can be caused by several different things if one leg becomes swollen suddenly  a blood clot must be considered it sounds like your swelling is in both legs so that is less likely some medications can cause swelling in the legs  so ask your doctor to review your medications for side effects if your circulatory system is having a problem  it can result in leg swelling  so it is important that your heart be evaluted some patients who dont get enough protein in their diet can get leg swelling  a blood test can diagnose this if patients have kidney or liver disease they can get leg swelling this is determined by blood testing also it sounds like you are having significant pain and persistent swelling so please have this swelling reevaluated medically
2143,if if you are healthy other than your gallbladder problem  without symptoms of urinary retention or obstruction  then it is likely that you will not need a urinary catheter many laparoscopic cholecystectomies are done as an outpatient  ie a few hours up to 23 hours in the ambulatory surgery area  and the procedure is generally between 12 hours under these circumstances  a urinary catheter is not usually needed however  you will have to urinate on your own before being discharged home on occasions  a straight cath may be needed  ie a catheter inserted to drain the bladder  if you cannot urinate
2144,from from your description  it could well have been broken when you hurt it a year ago i think the first thing you should do is see a hand surgeon you will probably need an xray and a good evaluation by the surgeon
2145,urinary retention severe urinary retention can lead to pain associated to a uti  dilated renal system hydroureter  hydronephrosis  or else a kidney infection pyelonephritis especially if a history of an enlarged prostate exists and even if he is prescribed flomax a visit to the doctor is definitely needed since the elderly may not show typical symptoms of an adult with a complex urinary tract infection
2146,your your symptoms do not suggest a sinus infection acute sinus infection mostly commonly follows a cold after 1014 days of a cold  and cold symptoms are not going away  you have to consider a sinus infection the symptoms are nasal congestion  nasal discharge  thick postnasal drainage that is yellowish or greenish particularly soon after arising half of the patients will have sinus headache or pressure mostly commonly at behind the eye area chronic sinus problem called chronic rhinosinusitis medically has the same symptoms as above but lasting longer than 3 months many patients have the similar symptoms lasting for months or years fatigue occurs in 80% of patients other symptoms include plugged ears and cough
2147,we we sometimes see hand numbness and swelling with compression of the nerves as they come down through the shoulder under the pectoralis muscle if the mris are normal ms is not a considerationif the ncv shows no nerve slowing at the wrist ask your doctor to feel for tight knots in the pectoralis minor muscle or just above the collar bone this is treated with stretching exercises and is often seen with poor posture it is most common in women with large breasts and in people who spend the day hunched over a computer keyboard
2148,visibly visibly bulging veins in the legs are often the result of http:  www nuvelaestheticacom veins_new veindiseasehtml>venous reflux  a condition where the blood in the deep veins of the leg is misdirected to the surface veins in a reverse flow pattern   rather than to the heart  as intended these veins are best treated by identifying the sources of venous reflux that feed them  and shutting them down traditionally   this was done surgically with the all too familiar vein stripping procedure the standard of care these days for treating venous reflux is an endovenous ablation ablation from inside the vein technique  like the vnus procedure or evlt intense pulse light ipl is a great tool for treating very fine vessels  1mm or less or for venous matting appearance of very fine mesh of red vessels in previously treated or traumatized areas it will not work on larger vessels generally speaking  and definitely not for bulging leg veins
2149,asthma can be mild asthma is defined as reversible bronchoconstrictrion  this can be mild that it can only be detected by lung function test some asthma patients only realize their condition after a puff of albuterol  as they get use to a mildly reduce pulmonary capacity
2150,have have this evaluated by an orthopedist you may require a knee aspiration not only for pain relief but also for fluid analysis this will differentiate between an infectious vs an arthritic process crystal analysis may even be able to establish the proper diagnosis the doctor will require xrays and may order additional testing
2151,pediatrician good evening  eczema is a very common condition many pediatricians are familial with its management ask your pediatrician if you need to see a specialist he or she will know whether the condition in your child is related to allergies  as is the case often if so a visit with an allergist who are very familiar eczema will address the cause of exacerbation knowing what makes it worse helps
2152,the the mitral valve closes when the heart beats to prevent blood from flowing backwards into the lungs when the mitral valve does not close properly one of the two leaflets of the valve may protrude beyond the other leaflet this is called mitral valve prolapse in most cases  it is harmless and patients are unaware that they have it up to 10% of the population has some mitral valve prolapse  but it generally does not affect them prolapse can lead to a situation wherein blood will leak backwards through the valve this is called mitral regurgitation mitral valves that have an abnormal structure can raise the risk for infection on the valve an echocardiogram is usually the best test for assessing mitral valve abnormalities generally a heart murmur suggests some degree of regurgitation most patients with mitral valve prolapse do not have symptoms and treatment is not needed
2153,i i applaud your desire to have information before you arrive to the appointment a few questions would be helpful did you ever have symptoms in the past any involvement of your eyes was the positive csf oligoclonal bands or elevated igg index the information you presented best fits with a monsymptomatic presentation as defined by the mcdonalds criteria which was designed to define those individuals who are likely to develop ms to secure the diagnosis you would need another clinical event or a change in your mri after 3 months they will probably want further testing including veps visual evoked potentials or oct optical coherence tomography the lab evaluation will include an ana  b12  folate  esr  vitamin d panel and routine labs they may also want a mri of the thoracic spine if the exam suggests spinal cord involvement good luck and well wishes
2154,lymph lymph nodes are sacks containing the bodies cells that fight infection and build up immunity these are the t cells and b cells the lymph nodes contain primarily t cells they are located in chains around the body set up to drain certain regions of the body the neck contains anterior and posterior cervical chains which is what your describing when drainage occurs and the material drained passes into and through the lymph nodeit is exposed to the cells mentioned above the cells recognise self and nonself substances if a substance is recognised as nonself then a stimulus process ensues this is clinically manifested by a swelling tenderness along the chain both allergens and infective particles ie pollen and bacteria can cause the exact same swelling result the answer to your question is yesit is very very likely from your seasonal allergies and not staph or strep true infections such as these cause different symptoms
2155,a a rare cause of chest pain in this age group is anomalous coronary artery although typically this will be detected by an astute cardiologist  it might be worth bringing up in discussion
2156,surgery is needed in just about all stages of curablle breast cancer  but the kind has changed while you can avoid mastectomy most of the time  some women opt for bilateral mastectomy to avoid screening no evidence of improved mortality lumpectomy is as good if not better than mastectomy with properly selected cases arm pit surgery for nodes has been questioned  but sentinel node is standard
2157,common that said  all surgeries are different  depending on the severity and type of impact ions also the patients age  health  etc make huge difference some post ops are much worse than others discuss your situation w your surgeon during your consult
2158,the the difficulty of the extraction cannot be determined without an examination  so it is difficult to answer your question your best course of treatment is to have your dentist and your physician discuss your concerns  determine the proper course of treatment  and advise you of the potential resks and complications of the procedure while taking this medication

2160,i i thought dr christensens answer was spoton  but id like to add my two cents in general  the presenting symptom of poor circulation is pain  not numbness numbness is a symptom of a nerve problem when you fall asleep on your arm and it feels numb and pinsandneedlelike  its because yove compressed a nerve  not cut off the circulation when you have a heart attack  its because an area of the heart muscle isnt getting enough oxygenated blood  and you feel pain people with poor circulation in their legs cant walk because of pain  not numbness incidentally  diabetics who frequently feel numbness  burning  etc in their feet are feeling problems with how their nerves function its not circulation that causes this if you began feeling numbness in your calves right after your back surgery  i think its a remarkable coincidence its hard to believe you developed poor circulation right after having surgery on your back nerves that bring sensation from the legs to the brain have to pass through the spinal cord  and any compression to the spinal cord or nerve roots can cause all sorts of symptoms in the legs  feet as dr christensen explained  the nerves in your back could be responding to the swelling and trauma of being manipulated during surgery if so  this usually clears up in time when you say the pulse in one foot is slower than the other  im guessing you mean it feels weaker less strong the best way to determine if you really do have an issue with circulation is to have plethysmography done  which is a simple  painless test to measure the circulation in your legs a vascular surgeon is the type of doctor who would do this if your circulation is fine and its just the nerves in your back that are responding to surgical manipulation  yoll probably be fine in a few weeks if the symptoms persist  acupuncture helps this nicely good luck
2161,you you have symptoms which are classic for gallstone disease and have been diagnosed with gallstones with what i assume was an ultrasound of the abdomen those are the only indications you need for surgery i would not wait until you have further symptoms or your symptoms worsen each time you have a gallbladder attack  you experience some chronic inflammation the more attacks you have  the more difficult it will make your surgery i would not waste any time
2162,if if he is truly bleeding behind the eye and not in the eye  then the blood loss is in the eye socket the orbit and can be due to many causes some of these causes are spontaneous rupture of an aneurysm and some are due to trauma he should stop blood thinners lots of different kinds after consulting with his pcp
2163,many possibilities rice rest  ice  compression  elevation immobilization with a splint or brace may be of benefit in the initial phase of recovery oral antiinflammatory medication may help with the pain and swelling once improved  mobilization and physical therapy can help restore strength and function healing times may vary
2164,for for sure  at least to get an xray to make sure nothing else needs to be done
2165,seattle  it seattle  it could be it could also be pericoronitis  a localized gum infection usually around the lose tissue of a partially erupted third molar either way  see your dentist for treatment infections can spread  and can rarely become life threatening it is nothing to mess with hope that is helpful  michael i wollock  dmd  agd fellow dentistry at suburban square 6106490313 wwwdentistryatsuburbansquarecom
2166,the the most effective dental devices work by pushing the lower jaw forward  thereby opening the air passage behind the tongue most are custom made by dentists and are adjusted periodically to find the most comfortable and effective position for the individual patient some things to expect: dry mouth when it occurs is usually transient and can often be compensated for by simple changes to the appliance a small subgroup of patients has persistent dry mouth that is impossible to accept there are patients with sjorgrenâ€™s syndrome  medication side effects and other conditions that predispose them to dry mouth and there are many over the counter and prescription remedies available i have found two products that patients report great success with use the first is rinsinol by oral b it is not marketed as a product for dry mouth but as a product for treating oral ulcers but it provides excellent coverage of mucosal tissues the second product is a prescription item made specifically to treat oral mucositis associated with chemotherapy i use it in an off label method with amazing success the product is gelclair and it comes packaged in a box of 21 small packages meant to be diluted with two tablespoons of water and rinsed around the mouth i found the product roughly equivalent to rinsinol when used in that fashion and very expensive i have many patients who use this product full strength and apply a small amount to their tissues and find it miraculous in how it controls dry mouth all night long an advantage to the off label method is one package can be used for several nights making it inexpensive to use it also works extremely well for oral ulcers in its undiluted form a problem frequently seen with oral appliances is pet dogs and cats have an affinity for eating  chewing and destroying them patients also are more likely to leave an oral appliance somewhere because it so small and does not require a special case bite changes are a more common phenomenon with oral appliances and are also easily reversible early on when the patient wears the appliance that keeps their jaw in a different position for eight hours healing occurs in joints and adaptation will often occur dentists usually give their patients exercisers or positioners to return to their original position patients are often not aware of the bite changes when patients are aware of the changes about 50% find them to be favorable it is rare to see a patient discontinue use due to the bite changes dentists are often more upset with the bite changes than the patients are there is also a subgroup of patients who experience tm joint problems or muscle pain when wearing appliances these problems are almost never a reason to not use oral appliances but they need to be addressed and treated by a dentist trained to deal with tmj disorders the remarkable fact is that 90â€“95% of oral appliance users report longterm satisfaction with their treatment the problems associated with appliance use are usually easily solved or well tolerated by patients many patients who start with treating their sleep apnea problems find that correcting the underlying tmj disorders an advantage not a problem similarly  many patients who start seeking treatment for tmj disorders find that they move on to treating their sleep problems because the underlying problems are the same it turns out that treating either problem usually helps both problems good luck
2167,gallstones gallstones and their symptoms can be highly variable from one person to another many people can walk around and feel normal with gallstones  and they do not need surgery other people with gallstones get upper abdominal gas and pressure discomforts with nausea or vomiting if you hare having gallstone pain and symptoms  which usually get worse with eating fatty or greasy foods  then you should see you family doctor to see if they recommend referral to a surgeon probably also not the best to wait for severe unrelenting abdominal pain and vomiting to occur
2168,yes yes it is possible that there small pieces of bone working there way out of your gums this can especially happen if you have had multiple teeth removed and the bone contoured for dentures its good that it didnt happen on the top i think you should call the clinic again to be seen are they aware that you are still in a lot of pain of course  if you lost your confidence in your present dentist a second opinion is a good idea however  stick with your present clinic and see if they can help resolve your problem satisfactority

2170,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs carries things too big to go into the arteries veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph for anything bad like bacteria viruses cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well
2171,you you swallow hundreds of times during the day our bodies have excellent defense mechanisms against draining from the infection however  the infection might be ruining the bone please go and see your dentist right away the other doctors advised you already
2172,well tolerated although every patient has a different experience after surgery  most patients who undergo male breast reduction surgery tend to do very well from the discomfort standpoint much  of course will depend on the patients specific procedure as well as concerns such as pain threshold the plastic surgeon will be your best resource when it comes to more specific answers
2173,radiation radiation treatment causes permanent and  frequently  progressive changes in tissue your best result may require repeated procedures if undertaken prematurely why dont you believe your treating physicians

2853,not always however we do worry about nodules with calcification more than other nodules as a significantly higher rate of being malignant
2854,genetic testing perhaps  yes but  before you do the test  you should have a detail discussion re  what is your risk for certain cancers  what kind of genetic testing needed  how to interprete the result   what the consequencies of the test are etc those above are things you should discuss either wih your oncologist or with a genetic counsellor discuss with your oncologist in detail

2867,yes while treatment of bipolar disorder with lithium has lessened over the past few decades  it is because newer medications with fewer side effects have become available in many instances  these newer medicines work very well sometimes  lithium is still the best and most effective treatment  and should definitely be considered an excellent choice
2868,dementia alzheimers and vascular dementia often coexist  and treatment is very similar for both both have cognitive memory dysfunction  but the progression with vascular dementia is more stairstepping down than alzheimers  which is more gradual dementia from a single large stroke looks different than from smallvessel disease possibly more frequency of depression with vascular dementia

2873,other ways to check for gout would be elevated uric acid in blood and by way of 24 hour urine tapping the joint is the definitive way there are reasons the tap could be negative  however  i would advise a rheumatology work up with complete bloodwork to rule out causes other han gout
2874,rarely virtually all stones can be visualized by ct scanning  except for the very rare indinavir stone prior to the widespread use of ct  stones that do not show up on xray films  like uric acid stones  were called radiolucent ct scanning is much more sensitive for the detection of stones than an ultrasound  and it is unlikely that stone visible on ultrasound is not seen on ct
2875,no that will not happen
2876,i think any guess is really conjecture without seeing having said that  you can try a topical steroid and if no improvement see the dermatologist
2877,different tests you had a thyroid ultrasound which evaluates the anatomy of your thyroid gland to find out if a thyroid nodule is hot or cold you need a nuclear thyroid scan aka i123 uptake and scan this latter is a functional test of your thyroid and characterizes nodules as hot  cold or warm isointense however  a 3 mm nodule is likely to small to characterize with a nuclear thyroid scan
2878,follow dr directions you are already under care of a doctor who has been doing the work up if you had fluttering and chest pressure  you have to complete cardiac work up good luck
2879,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs carries things too big to go into the arteries veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph for anything bad like bacteria viruses cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well

2883,not normal in men though urinary tract infections commonly occur in women since the urethra in men is longer and farther from the anus  utis in men arent common however  utis in men all require a workup to find the underlying cause so it can be addressed: 1sexually transmitted infection  2anatomical physiologic cause bacteria backwashes  or 3obstruction causing urine retention eg enlarged prostate

2887,tincture of time typically  antibiotic treatment is the best option to settle inflammation or drainage from an inflamed or infected sebaceous cyst once the inflammation has settled the best option is surgical excision of the lesion

2894,often times a simple surgical shoe may suffice or even a camwalker without any cast ultimately  it is the decision of the treating doctor
2895,not likely one factor is family history of this disease  like if a sister and mother also had it these cancers are hormone dependent  so early menarche  late menopause  and late no term pregnancies are at increased risk dietary fat intake may also be a risk factor but the environment you lived in is highly unlikely to have done this more likely is that you shouldve seen your dr so see dr asap
2896,staph infection by your description i am presuming your bf had an abscess which is being treated with abx usually seven to ten days of antibiotics suffices
2897,no and yes there is a blood test that we use in colon cancer  however it is not advised for screening there can be colon cancer without bleeding only 25% of colon cancers present with bleeding

2903,avoid phytoestrogens fibroids are a result of high estrogen levels high estrogen can be caused by excessive carbohydrate intake via competetive inhibition of glucoronidase enzyme therefore a low carb diet is beneficial to reduce estrogen and help shrink fibroids you may also have low iodine  thyroid problems  low progesterone all of these things should be evaluated all phytoestrogens should be avoided
2904,neuropathy perioperative trauma or non healing fracture or ligament sorain cause
2905,possibly i would recommend discussing this in detail with your medical oncologist being a stage one it is unlikely that chemo will be required as long as the tumor has been adequately removed surgically stage one breast cancer is a potentially very curable stage with the proper treatment
2906,common to get some scar tissue in the upper part of the lung just below the ribs this is often best appreciated on a ct scan most patients have no change in their breathing function  and the risk of developing a temporary inflammation pneumonitis is very low  but treatable with steroids this risk is probably lower with modern radiation techniques such as imrt
2907,maybe pet ct scan is a very sensitive test and may very well find additional sites of disease however  its sensitivity varies depending on the cancer histology and size of tumors unfortunately stage 4 means that the disease is advance and metastatic finding additional sites of disease may not significantly change the treatment plan and therefore may not be of additional help
2908,cyst th can be anything from a chalazion to a foreign body reaction to a bug bite to just a slow growing benign cyst you should be seen and evaluated by an ophthalmologist
2909,sinus surgery balloon sinuplasty  minimally invasive technique  uses a small balloon inflated to widen blocked passages  generally has less bleeding and shorter recovery time endoscopic sinus surgery  uses a small camera to visually examined the sinuses tiny surgical instruments inserted to remove obstructive tissues  does not require any incision as the whole procedure is performed through the nostrils

2937,warm compresses for superficial vein thrombosis  try warm compresses  systemic antiinflammatory such as naprosyn  and topical antiinflammatory such as aspercreme
2938,theyre not uncommo meniscal tears are common when you say you had another tear on the other side  i think you are referring to the medial versus lateral meniscus as opposed to right versus left side this additional tear may or may not be causing your symptoms the best way to know is to be evaluated by an orthopaedic surgeon familiar with knee problems your original surgeon may be a good place to start

2950,chemoembolization chemoembolization is a good option for patients who are not candidates for other therapies  but it is not a good choice when liver function is poor in general  we dont do chemoembolization in patients with bilirubin levels above 3 0  baseline encephalopathy  or ast or alt levels above 100 unless the patient has hepatitis  in which case 100 is not too bad blood clotting issues are usually correctable and should not impact the plan to do chemoembolization chemoembolization is not considered curative  but rather palliative that means that it slows the tumor down  which may help to keep the patient within acceptable limits for transplantation external beam radiation is not usually used in liver cancer because the normal liver is more sensitive to radiation than the tumor is on the other hand  it is often possible to do internal radiation with a technique called selective internal radiation therapy sirt  also known as radioisotope embolization this technique can be used in patients with very compromized liver function and appears to be very effective here are the names and phone numbers of two doctors in arizona who use the sirt technique: charles k raker  md  602 2394622 phoenix  az  dept of radiology banner good samaritan hospital william j romano  md  fsir  480 4409784 phoenix  az  mdig vip

2963,need need more info do you have a kitten
2964,nocturnal nocturnal  nighttime numbness and tingling and pain in the hand can be associated with carpal tunnel syndrome while diabetes can give peripheral neuropathy typically the tingling associated with diabetic neuropathy will affect both hands equally as well as the feet however with diabetes or any other systemic problem that can affect nerves and circulation  the presence of the underlying disorder can worsen the symptoms of carpal tunnel when it gets worse this also means that diabetes sometimes prevents the pain form occurring early on and when it does occur may feel worse suddenly nonetheless the reason carpal tunnel seems to be worse at night when sleeping is several fold 1  the pressure on the nerve is increased by the increased tissue pressure form lying down  the fluid that sits outside the cells redistributes itself to the face and upper extremity when someone lies down  its why feet are swollen at the end of the day and the face feels puffy and fingers stiff in the am this extra fluid increases the pressure on the nerve a second thing that often occurs when one sleeps unsplnted is that the wrists flexed or extended  also putting more pressure on the nerve the pressure builds  the fingers go numb  pain follows and finally the pain build enough to awaken the sufferer to start  a simple wrist splint may suffice to help with the night time symptoms not too tight as that can cause pressure on the nerve too defeating the purpose next antiinflammatories  otc non steroidal antiinflammatories but if someone is a diabetic taking other medications then they should always check with their pcp family doctor internist or endocrinologist before taking nsaid s as the y can have a deleterious effect upon renal  kidney function a pcp may prescribe antiinflammatories as well injections of corticosteroids are often used acutely by hand surgeons for non operative care a nerve conduction study and emg can help define delineate the role of carpal tunnel v  neuropathy start with a pcp and consider seeing a hand surgeon once the work up is initiated  
2965,be be patient and wait for the reading from the radiologist dont make your own diagnosis
2966,autonomic autonomic neuropathy can indeed give bowel and bladder problems along with peripheral neuropathy there are tests that would be done by a urologist to evaluate the nature of your bladder dysfunction a neurologist would do an electromyographic study to evaluate peripheral nerve function if you are diabetic or prediabetic you may be developing neuropathy while ms can cause bowel and bladder problems during the course of the disease  it doesnt usually cause peripheral nerve involvement your neurologist will probably request an emg test along with autonomic testing
2967,this this definitely sounds like a problem of decreased blood flow in all likelihood  you have an arterial narrowing or blockage in your pelvis or leg in many cases  these abnormalities can be treated easily using minimally invasive techniques yoll need to be examined by a vascular specialist and have some testing done in the meanwhile  it would probably be a good idea to start taking a baby aspirin every day assuming you have no allergies to aspirin or history of ulcers or abnormal bleeding this will reduce the likelihood of your arteries becoming completely occluded by clot

2973,treat cancer spread like this is not usually treated for cure  but to relieve symptoms always ask how is this going to help me  what are the side effects and more we have to ask: is it worth what it costs i tell my patients these things  but often offer whether i would do it if it were me getting it done little benefit of xrt to liver kidney  so use is puzzling
2974,headaches not likely  but get checked out by an ent physician

2977,hopefully hopefully the doctor took a sample of your urine and sent it to the lab for a urine culture the reason this is done is to obtain identification and sensitivity results this means that the type of bacteria causing the infection will be identified and the antibiotics that will work to erradicate the bacteria will also be identified  a well as those that will not work i do not recommend you take amoxicillin i suggest you call the doctor and inform them of your continued symptoms hopefully the culture was sent and the appropriate antibiotic can be started if not then your doctor will likely send out a urine culture and start you another antibiotic and adjust accordingly good luck
2978,it can lung transplant for cf is an important life prolonging therapy but it exchanges one set of problems for another after transplant  there is risk of rejection of the transplanted lungs by ones own immune system requiring use of strong meds that suppress your immune system which then increases your risk of serious infections there are many facets to this  talk to your cf dr to discuss pros cons

2985,i i do not know any other medical history from you  but if no medical contra indication   i would recommend genral anesthesia thanks
2986,dr dr fowler took the words right out of my mouth sudden onset of pain  redness  heat  swelling involving a big toe is the typical presentation of gout considering you have high blood pressure  and since nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication like ibuprofen have the potential to cause fluid retention and therefore raise blood pressure  i would most definitely seek your doctors advice on this hyzaar contains a thiazide diuretic that is wellknown to raise uric acid levels if this is a gout attack yore having  it might be advisable to switch blood pressure medication to something else just as an aside  we no longer consider diet a factor in gout the three biggest offenders in precipitating a gouty attack are aspirin  beer and certain medications like the one yore on feel better
2987,not not necessarily wisdom teeth extraction is a very traumatic process and it is very possible to have numbness for days or weeks almost all the time  your feeling will come back slowly if you are still numb tomorrow  go see your dentist he she may prescribe a steroid to help the healing process the initial numbness from the dental anesthetic should last no more than 8 hours  but most last 4+ hours
2988,lazy lazy eye is generally permanent after the age of 11 or 12 if she is younger than this  i strongly encourage you to wear her glasses once the brain no longer wants the vision from an eye  that eye will never have the chance of better vision there is a window to teach the brain to use an eye vision could get worse  but more importantly it will never get better

2991,the the propanolol reduces shakiness and fast heart beat that would get with low blood sugar you should still sweat and feel weak and find your sugar low  below 70 if you do go low follow your sugars closely and you should let the doctor know if you go low or if you must eat to avoid low sugars there are drugs that control diabetes well but do not cause low sugars see my post below on my blog site also  you might consider seeing another doctor perhaps you have endocrinologists in the area
2992,recommend recommend an evaluation by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon to determine the source of your jaw pain and to evaluate the third molars the two things are probably not related but both pose a potential problem for you long term the jaw pain could be due to a joint problem  muscle problem  or an infection
2993,if if symptoms are not improving or ameliorated within one week despite conservative measures such as a neti pot  sinus irrigation and decongestants  you probably should be seen if the pain is progressing  or the drainage is purulent  malodorous and puslike you should be seen sooner for initiation of antibiotic therapy a neti pot will not treat an infectious cause for sinonasal complaints  it merely removes particulate and secretory matter  and often affords symptomatic relief for mild congestive inflammatory symptoms
2994,sore throat could be strep throat  does your child have fever  headache  vomiting or sore throat
2995,splint first the single most early effective thing to do os to wear a well fitting wrist splint at night  not too tight using antiinflammatories helps but taken with food and try to take if ok with your obgyn and it dies not upset your stomach or cause other health issues and cleared by your ob gym a hand surgeon may be able to offer an injection which can elevate blood sugar a bit so get clearance

3001,troubling these symptioms are troubling and suggest that there is some problem within your ankle joint or a tendon in the area see an orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeon one in your area can be found at wwwaofasorg
3002,maybe calf pain that radiates down into the ankle could be a dvt but there are certainly muscular  ligamentous  and tendinous problems that can give you the same symptoms although swelling and redness certainly dont happen all the time with a dvt  there is probably a reasonable chance this is not a dvt as dr ryan said  though  the only real way to know is to get a scan
3003,magnesium if orthototics do not help  tendonitis may respond to prolotherapy cramps can be due to electrolyte imbalance consider magnesium and potassium supplementation  and drink lots of water between meals check my website for details on magnesium supplementation webpage: drfairchildorg

3007,no dvt filters are not for everybody generally not needed nowadays removable filters are recommended and put in  if conditions where anticogulation can not be immediately performed due to bleeding or other causes tpa is not needed in all cases either
3008,yes unfortunately there is a limit to the resolution of a chest xray small lesions can be missed in addition  a chest xray is just a 2 dimensional projection comparing desities of different structures if a tumor happens to overlap with another structure of the same density then you cant even see it a ct scan can give a higher resolution picture but even it can miss a tumor at times
3009,namanda is an nmda nmethyldaspartate receptor antagonist  which may slow nerve damage
3010,cheap treatment yes get rid of the dog or cat
3011,use supplements lasik can lower tear product or alter tear composition so the tears evaporate more readily treatment is by supplementary tears  and punctal occlusion with plugs flax seed oil ingestion can help there is nothing that actually increases tear volume in these circumstances
3012,plantar fascitiis does not have to be painful in the heel the fascia originates in the heel runs under the arch and inserts near the base of the toes so anywhere along its course you could have pain try wearing an arch support
3013,it may take awhile the lip could be numb from the affects of local anesthetic injected while you were asleep  in which case it may be a day or so before it wakes up  the are could also be numb because of stretching and pressure on nerves while extracting the teeth in this case  it may be a longer time before the sensation returns  possibly months
3014,chest xray a chest xray can spot a lesion which maybe lung cancer additional test would be necessary to confirm cancer an echo is an ultrasound of the heart it would not directly show a lesion the lung is full of air which does not work well with echo

3020,floaters   flashing an acute onset of floaters   flashing is usually from a vitreous detachment  esp between ages 50  70 with a normal retinal exam  the floaters come from debris pulled away from the optic nerve  and flashing from the gradual pulling away of the vitreous from the retina this process continues for days  weeks until it has completed nevertheless  i would contact your doctor about being rechecked
3021,probably helpful early ambulation  within a couple of days  has clearly been shown to be beneficial as long as things are stable on your medications and running doesnt cause pain  it is ok to do as others have said  though  clear it with you own doctor first and dont forget your compression stockings

3023,not likely while lasik and laser eye surgery are fantastic options that can enable a person to have less depenedence on glasses or contacts  not all patients are candidates for these procedures also  personal preference still drives many patients to choose glasses or contacts over laser vision correction optometrists also play a role in the diagnosis and initial management of eye diseases
3024,low grade arthritis i have many patients with ccps > 250 with minimal disease activity other indicators of disease activity more important than ccp titer are: albumin globulin ratio higher the better and anemia hgb goes down with disease activity i would base treatment on disease activity  not the ccp tests crp and esr being normal are far more important in activity assessment  along with active synovitis
3025,follow up ck sometimes ear infections do not clear up i recommend a follow up ear recheck
3026,slipped epiphysis this condition is usually seen in overweight children  primarily boys before you do any surgery have him loses few pounds if he is overweight
3027,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs carries things too big to go into the arteries veins like bacteria eaten by white cells digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph everywhere for bad stuff like bacteria viruses cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well
3028,flat feet from a podiatric perspective thats what id look at other possibilities could include juvenile arthritic conditions
3029,essentiallyno intraocular lenses are made of materials such as acrylic  silicone  or pmma  which are materials that are essentially inert and the body does not recognize or react with them however  if there are bacteria or other substances that make their way into the eyes along with the lens  the body can have a reaction against these

3044,need more testing a noncontrast ct is a good screening exam for many conditions  but may not be as sensitive as mri you should be examined by a neurologist  and if he feels that it is warranted  a contrast mri study will afford a more precise diagnosis
3045,yes a fine needle biopsy or core biopsy may have a false negative in other words missed a cancer even if the biopsy is negative this is especially true if the mass is large and there is no way to sample the whole thing without its removal
