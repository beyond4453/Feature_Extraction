300,postsurgical is this the same pain as preop or is it a new pain sounds like either the operation wasnt totally successful or a new problem has cropped up either way  see your surgeon for an opinion could be a new pinched nerve  a hardware issue with the fusion  or a nerve injury of some type is it getting better worse compare the pain to preop better or worse all questions to discuss w  ur surgeon
301,wisdom teeth sounds like a wisdom tooth problem if you havent had them removed get to a dentist to check them for you could also be from a very advanced cavity resulting in a tooth abcess
302,no tingling and numbness in distal extremities is very suggestive of some type of peripheral neuropathy have full general checkup with your primary doc then may need neurology consult and tests  eg nerve conduction diabetes and alcohol nerve toxicity are common causes if regular means intermittent and no sx between them  perhaps it is hyperventilation  a form of anxiety panic attack
303,yes it is possible and very easy to check  do a home pregnancy test and if negative and you dont want to be pregnant use birth control including barrier contraception
304,probably not its probably just a dissolvable suture under the skin you can try to pick it out with some tweezers if your knee is having a lot of pain or if there is significant redness you should be seen by your orthopedist or his assistant
305,i think breast ca physicians do speak a foreign tongue at times many patients ask me when the have spread of cancer to a bone  if they have bone cancer breast cancer cells in lung cancer are more likely breast cancer cells that have spread to the lung there would be a cancerous mass in the lung and a biopsy would show breast cancer cells this would be metastatic cancer to the lung i think that is your issue
306,suspicious only imaging techniques other than an mri may be an indication of the level of suspicion for malignancy in the context of several other findings on history and physical examination however  a diagnosis ultimately requires a biopsy
307,probably normal ever pregnancy is different and breast tenderness is variable  if you have confirmed the pregnancy by ultrasound and no heavy bleeding  i would not be concerned
308,yes stress urinary incontinence is caused by relaxation of the pelvic floor muscles usually due to stretching during childbirth in women it is rare to nonexistant in males it is best initially managed using kegel exercises which can be reviewed on the internet
309,call your md it is not a good idea to take motrin or other nsaids during pregnancy it may cause premature closure of a duct in the babys heart if you have pain call your ob now and she can prescribe another type of medicine or you may go to urgent care
310,multiple symptoms your best bet is consultation by a neurologist
311,antihistamine like benadryl  ice to the area and elevation if no improvement and condition worsens head to your local emergency room
312,its likely that you have dense breasts  which in itself may be a br ca risk they are chasing a suspicious finding usually the u s gives sufficient imaging to nable a biopsy  and only that proves that you do or do not have cancer mr is indicated in dense breasts it sees where mammo is blind  but it finds things that do not prove to be cancer in all instances you do not have ca until they prove it
313,allergies  try an antihistimine like tavist d
314,your call that would be up to you and your instincts i never argue with patients that want another read i usually trust the radiologist and if they want to repeat in 6 months that is because they dont want to miss anything that is too early to call now sounds like they are being cautious sometimes an mri can help with a questionable lesion but they are expensive and insurance fights paying for them
315,more info needed it´s not easy to answer that one what will be done and how  and according to whom straightening teeth can be both for cosmetic and functional reasons cosmetic treatment may or may not involve surgery  such as orthognathic surgery is this for insurance coverage an insurance plan may or may not cover specific procedures i wish you gave us more information for a better answer

320,several things if you are just a primary snorer  you can try simple things  like sleeping on your back they sell tshirts with tennis balls on the back  avoid alcohol and sedatives  and lose weight if you are a robust snorer  you may have a conditon called sleep apnea which can be quite serious see your md for a sleep study to determine this  and to discuss options
321,it can especially if there is a weakness under the urethra  tube you pee through there are many surgical and non surgical options check out wwwvoicesforpfdorg
322,antiinflammatory if your doctor says everything is fine and you are still having lots of pain  take your antiinflammatories like ibuprofen and advil every 6 to 8 hours for 24 hours to help minimize the inflammation then take as needed hot compress on the areas around tmj helps a lot as well good luck
323,sinus infection the problem may be chronic sinusitis saline irrigation with a neil med sinurinse bottle might do a better job of clearing any debris a good exam by an ent  including a nasal endoscopy would best examine for the origin of bad breath sometimes your breath isnt as bad as you imagine  also
324,tissue damage as the baby passes through the birth canal it can cause damage to the supportive tissues around the vagina  bladder  urethra and rectum in time this can lead to mobility in the urethra and leaking urine with certain activities it can also result in dropping or prolapse of the pelvic organs
325,likely panic attacks during a panic attacks  you are likely to experience symptoms similar to a heart attackshortness of breath  pounding rapid heart beat  sweating  dizziness  chest pain  nausea  and some even passes out this tends to get worse because every time it happens you get scared and worry about when the next one will come it is very treatablemany effective options please consult doc good luck
326,agree will need to see a urogyn and discuss surgery vs pessary options
327,yes but yes as long as they dont cause drowsiness and thus affecting your alertness i usually suggest to patients to take something like fexofenadine allegra 180 mg during the day and whatever works for them in the evening zyrtec causes some drowsiness in slightly over 10% of the people and benadryl over 30% in my own experience
328,very possible sinus infections can cause the upper teeth to hurt  especially the back ones combined with your other symptoms i would think you have a rather bad cold combined with a sinus infection i would visit your doctor asap for an evaluation

335,first of all congratulations on your survival and i know you stopped smoking if teh simple imaging of cxr and ct are negative  and you still cough  i would get pfts  including abg and dlco id see a pulmonary doctor and make sure a bronchoscopy was not indicated or a pet scan highly unlikely to be related to your old disease or treatment
336,yes things can grow on top of each other in the skin happens all the time you can get malignant things on top of benign things  benign things growing on top of other benign things  etc melanomas can also be seen right next to or even in other benign moles
337,read instructions most  if not all  hair color agents advise a skin test for allergy to components b4 doing the hair white bumps may be dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis  that may respond to selsun blue shampoo with selenium or antifungal shampoo like nizoral try to get scalp under control b4 coloring hair  do test on skin first
338,if pain is going sometimes things dont show up and we must attempt to treat what may not appear obvious but clinical judgement leads us to if all other test ruled out pathology the trigrminal nerve in the face is the most complicated nerve in the body  cause sensation  movement  and a multitude of other inervations  this nerve can cause some of your symptoms at this point you need to see if the root canal works
339,yes  it may it is not feasible to know without examining the lesions  but if the primary subungual lesion is a melanoma  it is a malignant tumor and can spread any where in the body
340,iud if no hormones are administered  then medication side effects dont occur discuss your contraceptive requirements with your womens health care provider
341,knee high studies have shown that regardless of where your clot was  knee high stockings are all you need what is more important is that your stockings give you 3040 mm hg of graduated compression ted hose are not enough you also need to wear them every day for at least two years in order to reduce your risk of getting a complication of dvts you dont want to have called post thrombotic syndrome
342,could be permanent i agree with dr smith it can take months wearing compression stockings right away will help but it is essential to wear the stockings for at least wo years to help to decrease your chance that the swelling might never go away
343,mammogram mammograms are generally better at screening for breast cancer ultrasound is used more for a focus evaluation of an area of the breast that might be suspicious or appear abnormal
344,very different if you mean lumpectomy + radiation  the main side effects are some shrinkage of the breast in most cases and some firmness some patients have occasional breast pain  but usually not too bad if the nodes inn the armpit are removed  swelling of the arm may be a possibility
345,it depends on how active you are and how much was done during surgery for a routine knee scope i typically allow my patients back to work in 34 days if they have a sedentary job otherwise  most people can start getting back to work at 23 weeks depending on their job strengthening of the quadriceps muscle is key as this shuts down with knee surgery of any kind most people are near full by 4 weeks
346,sleep apnea if your child even has 1 episode an hour of sleep apnea treatment is recommended i would not wait at all  referral to have a sleep study in a childrens hospital setting would be my first priority
347,it may have moved the fracture may have moved after having seen the first doctor if it does not need surgery  follow their guidance on how to prevent further displacement
348,no a person with a dental abcess must take antibiotics over a course of a week to suppress the bacteria causing the infection however  the abcess can be cured only extracting the tooth or undergoing a root canal procedure dental abcesses can be deadly  please seek dental care quickly
349,it depends i have completed thousands of root canals on infected cases in one visit when a root canal is done microscopically  we can clean shape sterilize and fill canals in one visit most of the time if your nodes are swollen  you should be on an antibiotic  which your dentist will see when he examines you next sometimes when there is a longstanding lesion at the root ends  surgical removal is necessary
350,sounds like it your description sure sounds like a sleep apnea problem you need to see your doctor asap and hopefully get referred for a sleep study so treatment can be initiated dont hesitate
351,get it checked get examined because several there are conditions such as a bakers cyst that can present themselves in the back of the knee and pinch a nerve to cause tingling in the toes you also have to rule out a more serious clot dvt examination and tests such as an ultrasound doppler would be used to diagnose
352,femoral nerve injuries are unusual  but certainly possible you should consult a your anesthesiologist right away he should set you up with a neurologist who can evaluate the etiology and extent of the injury nerves can take a long time to heal you may also inquire about a physical therapy program good luck
353,mammo and ultrasound are complementary tests some abnormalities may be seen on one  but not the other so a suspicious mammo finding that cannot be seen on ultrasound is still a suspicious mammo finding  and likely needs biopsy
354,disc displacement disc displacement with reduction is usually not accompanied by pain indicating that most patients are able to adapt to the dysfunction no treatment is needed
355,most likely noisy or grinding knees are rarely a concern unless accompanied by pain the most common cause of knee grinding is altered mechanics within the patellofemoral joint causing the backside of the kneecap to rub against the groove in the femur quadriceps weakness after acl surgery can lead to these altered biomechanics continue your rehab  with a focus on quad and hamstring strengthening
356,12 weeks surgery on the hand always causes swelling the best thing you can do is to keep it elevated all of the time since most of the swelling is water and water runs downhill
357,several things soak in warm soapy water and then use a pumice stone or callous file to remove the hard skin then use a moisturizer cream to soften the skin

361,question unclear bilateral leg swelling can have many causes whether prior cellulitis in one extremity played any role is difficult to know  but was unlikely to have been responsible for both legs congestive heart failure  lymphatic insufficiencies  venous insufficiency  and other systemic causes are more probable
362,no there is no benefit i am aware of with antioxidants helping chemotherapy there are theoretical reasons why antioxidants can impair chemotherapies ability to kill cancer cells i would not take additional unproven supplements without a md approval or without being on a clinical trial to study it antioxidants have harmed people in randomized studies the wont harm  might help mantra is out
363,no and dont do the last thing you would want to do is dislodge carotid plaques if it breaks off  it will follow the flow of blood and lodge in brain causing strokes the rough surface then attracts clots which can also cause stroke treatment is done by either carotid endarterectomy or stenting  as well as medical management again  a stable plaque is a small problem compared to a broken one
364,mole nothing can substitute clinical examination so  if you are worried about it  you need to go back to your doctor and have the mole evalated i cant tell you for sure whether it is something that you have to be cocerned about without examining the mole
365,virus you are most likely fighting off a virus or bacteria you should see your doctor for a full evaluation  though
366,maybe depends on how long after surgery and how bad your nerve was damaged before the surgery by the pressure on it many surgeons give local anesthetics so it maybe numb for several days from the local if your nerve was severely damaged prior to the surgery  it will take longer to recover and tingling is often a sign of the nerve recovering this may last for up to a year
367,you did not mention how long ago you had the surgery also  where on the foot do you have those symptoms it may be related or may not  but more info is needed to discern you can follow up with the surgeon as he is familiar with your case

370,dentist or oral surg the cause of the dental abscess is the critical information that needs to be known it could be caused by an infected nerve in a tooth or also an infection in the gum tissue i agree with the other answers that you should not attempt to drain it yourself the infection could spread into the surrounding tissues and blood stream  creating more complications
371,drainage the drainage from the sinuses and or the antibiotic could be causing the vomiting contact your childs physician and explain to them what is going on
372,swollen painfull gla it is better to see u pcpfor evaluation and assesment and to r o any infection
373,see your doctor this problem can only be solved by seeing your doctor and being evaluated facetoface after a thorough examination  your doctor should be able to tell you whats wrong and what to do about it

375,depends if your surgery was done as an outpatient and you dont have to do a lot of lifting  riding as a passenger should be ok if you are planning to drive yourself  i dont recommend driving if you are taking narcotic pain medicine
376,yes yes it can  there are things like gallbladder stones or different kind of cysts that can be seen and assessed much better on ultrasound versus ct scan
377,vaginitis this may well be bacterial vaginosis  or potentially some other form of infection see your doctor  get diagnosed and treated and have a pleasant odor
378,carpal tunnel not unique for a diabetic to have some nerve issues perhaps your median nerve is compressed over the wrist causing carpal tunnel syndrome this should be readily reversible talk to your doctor and perhaps get an emg test to evaluated the severity and decide appropriate treatment
379,possibly a cavity in a wisdom tooth can cause jaw symptoms even in absence of temporomandibular disorders consult a dentist before symptoms get worse
380,advice look  a fever means infection usually a urinary tract infection doesnt have fever fever means the infection is moving up the urinary tract could be you have a kidney infection dont mess with this could lead to an infection in the blood  damaged kidneys and loss of work advice: get it checked out losing work with cost you more now  high tail it to your doc

385,probably not unless your serum pregnancy test was done way too early  you are not pregnant based on it being negative if you are still in doubt  repeat urine pregnancy in 2 weeks if negative  go back to your routine  however  make sure if you wait 2 weeks until the next pregnancy test  you use an alternative reliable method of contraception  such as abstinence or condoms

389,see dr may be your gallbladder
390,us vs mammo it depends on what you mean by effective the sensitivity of screening mammo and screening us is close  with us detecting 34 cancers per 1000 patients and mammo detecting 45us performs better in the dense breast category  mammo performs better in fatty breasts their roles are complementary  and evolving the current main role of us is to further evaluate abnormalities seen on mammo or exam
391,no the acl is the primary restraint that prevents the shin bone tibia from sliding forward from beneath the thigh bone femur when the acl is torn you develop unwanted pathologic anterior knee instability the hamstrings are the secondary restraints strengthening them will minimize but not eliminate anterior knee instability following an acl tear
392,see your surgeon clicking in knee replacements is very common as the parts are metal and plasticpolyethylene popping may indicate some swelling or fluid build up in the knee you should see your knee surgeon or knee replacement specialist to have it evaluated
393,no most patients respond well to exercise  bracing and antiinflammatory medications very few eventually need surgery
394,yes usually you can see tumors that have spread to the lungs on an xray however  you can have stage 4 cancer without there being any cancer in the lungs i had a patient once who had stage 4 kidney cancer and her lungs were totally fine
395,see a doctor you need to see a regular doctor to confirm the diagnosis and to start oral antibiotics
396,have it evaluated a person with chest pain needs to be evaluated and treated appropriately multiple possible causes may be: heart attack  esophageal reflux  anxiety  musculoskeletal  pneumonia  pulmonary embolus  and aortic dissection have it evaluated right away to prevent potential serious complications

401,culture wound or drainage needs to be cultured
402,the the best initial breast biopsy is a needle biopsy it usually allows the diagnosis to be made in the least invasive way many women who have a needle biopsy will not need to have a surgical biopsy for women who do get a recommendation for a surgical biopsy  having the results of the needle biopsy allows the surgeon to individualize the operation to the patients circumstances
403,yes to 1st  a core needle biopsy is a special needle that is larger and takes large pieces of breast tissue it is very accurate plain needle biopsy is probably referring to a fine needle biopsy this is a smaller needle and does not get actual pieces of breast tissue it gets cells for cytology which is not as accurate as a core biopsy
404,great great question no  angioplasty and stent placement are only mechanical fixes for the underlying obstruction only through controlling cholesterol  diabetes  high blood pressure  taking aspirin  stopping smoking  exercising  and losing weight can you prevent plaque from forming again this is why the medications you take after angioplasty stent placement are so very important for your long term heart health they are really the only ways to hopefully prevent future procedures
405,too many drugs here the combination of all this medication is not a good option in my opinion and i dont believe increasing doses of any individual one of these will help you sleep any better i like the idea of working toward nonpharmacological ways to approach your insomnia before using all these agents again  speaking to your doctor before changing would be best but ultimately  i think for you  less is more

415,no if all of your treatment is completed as you are followed by your oncology team with breast exams  mammograms and md breast exams  pet scan will offer little to no benefit there r also some blood markets that can be used to evaluate for early recurrence and this merit additional studies routinely though after treatment for an early stage breast cancers do not require pet scan for surveillance
416,likely migraine if you have had even off and on so called  normal headaches which in reality are mild headaches  in the past  then most probably you are having migraine headaches your family members may also have headaches of less or more severity
417,this this is likely related to your allergy as the others have noted would not do anything to the bubble as you may cause problems would see an opthalmologist  not an optometrist  as already mentioned would get eye drops like patanol or pataday or an antihistamine eye drop from an allergist or the eye md
418,an an ac separation can occur with negative xrays for fracture a grade  separation may not show any xray findings a higher grade injury may only be apparent with a weight holding film a more severe injury may show that physically there is a notch  bump or step off at the ac joint even if the radiologist read the xray as negative the ac joint is stressed if one brings their arm across their chest trying to touch the opposite shoulder this ois called adduction of the arm elevation will also be a problem  if the ac joint is sprained even a low grade injury may take 45 weeks or more to feel better tennis  especially overhead shots may take longer it sound as if an evaluation by an orthopedic surgeon who takes care of shoulder problems is needed
419,have have you spoken to your doctor or the person covering him one needs to look at the rash and have more info  to give you the best answer
420,there there are many problems that can cause your symptoms  as the other docs mentioned allergy is a little less likely  because it usually affects both eyes at the same time for temporary relief  use some overthecounter tear drops  or a gettheredout drop for one or 2 days if your vision is blurry  or if you have pain or increasing swelling  you should see medical care immediately
421,the the mitral valve closes when the heart beats to prevent blood from flowing backwards into the lungs when the mitral valve does not close properly one of the two leaflets of the valve may protrude beyond the other leaflet this is called mitral valve prolapse in most cases  it is harmless and patients are unaware that they have it up to 10% of the population has some mitral valve prolapse  but it generally does not affect them prolapse can lead to a situation wherein blood will leak backwards through the valve this is called mitral regurgitation mitral valves that have an abnormal structure can raise the risk for infection on the valve an echocardiogram is usually the best test for assessing mitral valve abnormalities generally a heart murmur suggests some degree of regurgitation most patients with mitral valve prolapse do not have symptoms and treatment is not needed

426,yes after a lumpectomy and whole breast radiation  there is a 1215% chance that breast cancer will come back in the same breast within 5 years however  the chance of recurrence is much higher without radiation therapy
427,yes if it comes back as just one lesion then radiosurgery is indicated if it comes back more extensively then chemotherapy and or hormonal therapy is needed in this situation radiation can be used to help any symptoms from the cancer that came back
428,see neurologist your history is too nonspecific to confirm ms  but one white matter lesion may be a clue repeat mri in 6 months if your problems continue  new lesions  especially gadolinium positive  could confirm ms if you lack confidence in current physician  get a second opinion
429,different strokes some people have more extensive surgery than others thats like saying 2 people  both with broken legs  have different rxone has a walking cast  the other a cast from toes to hip your oral surgeon will go over pain management instructions with you follow those instructions to the letter and you should be ok hope you do better than your friend
430,abscess  antibiotic for the most part an untreated cavity is a common cause of tooth abscess as the cavity erodes the enamel  it works its way into the inside of the tooth creating an abscess pus pocket a root canal is the only way to remove the infection and save the tooth when ignored  this infection spreads to the surrounding jawbone and the tooth become hopeless and extraction is indicated
431,yes  but especially if other teeth have moved to allow room impacted means that something was blocking eruption now that tooth is coming in you may have soreness from eruption think teething or from irritated gum tissue around the tooth now that you are having a problem please go back to see your dentist for resolution or referral

436,the the removal of breast implants is dependent on whether the scar capsule surrounding these implants is also going to be removed  the actual removal without capsulectomy scar removal is relatively quick  but is also dependent on whether or not there is a leaking silicone implant versus a saline implant the removal of silicone can take a bit longer than saline

440,to to begin  strokes are not that common a cause of headache  although it depends a bit on what is meant by stroke the majority of strokes are infarcts  death of brain tissue from loss of blood supply  and these more often than not are not associated with headache the other major kind of stroke is hemorrhage  and those often have headaches  often sudden and severe other causes of severe headache with neurological deficits such as slurred speech or dizziness can include brain tumors  brain vascular diseases such as vasculitis or arteriovenous malformations  or even leaking aneurysms you should definitely see a neurologist to be evaluated for the cause of your symptoms and signs  and promptly  as these may be warning signs of a serious but treatable condition which  left alone  could be disabling or even fatal
441,the the knot you described in your breast sounds like a cyst  which can increase in size if you consume a lot of caffeine these cysts often tend to hurt right before your period as far as breast cancer screening goes  for women who have a first degree relative your mother in this case with breast cancer  then screening for them would start ten years before the age your mother was when she was diagnosed for instance if your mother was diagnosed at age 40  your screening would start at age 30 if your doctor is not following this protocol  then you should seek another opinion all the best
442,this this is a good question when your teeth are cleaned it is entirely possible that the hygienist has worked below the gum line to remove calculus  the tarter that accumulates when the plaque in not removed efficiently and and becomes calcified the instruments that penetrate below the gum displace the tissue and they are used to scrap off the calculus and the lining of the gum pocket is stretched and scraped this will produce an inflammatory response  and one of the five signs of inflammation is tumor from the latin which means swelling there i think that answers your question dr neil mcleod dds dentistry nthat lasts  quality that counts
443,pain happens after most surgical procedures in mastectomy  a nerve that exits the side of the breast is usually injured or sacrificed and irritation of is causes pain or noxious tingling especially when the arms swing during walking swelling is independent of that and can be caused by removal of lymph nodes and exacerbated by not putting the limb thru frequent adequate range of motion usually out of fear of pain
444,maybe recurrence after radiation most often means mastectomy unfortunately  after radiation for breast cancer  the tissue is changed in a way that limits the options for reconstruction ordinarily the simplest method uses a tissue expander followed by an implant  but radiated tissue doesnt expand well and capsular contracture is common flaps such as diep or tram are preferable in that instance
445,low grade its not really a fever but if you havent passed the stone by now you should follow up for other options
446,yes yes a pacifier is the lesser of the two evils 1 the thumb transfer the weight of the whole arm and leverages off the lower front teeth to exert an upward pressure against the palate changing the shape of the palate 2 orthodontic pacifiers are available that are flatter than your childs thumb that will cause less distortion of her front teeth 3 you can wean her off the pacifier and eventually take it away my grandchildren helped pack them up and brought the to the mailbox to send them to a nonexistent younger child

450,you you do not provide enough information to give a concise answer on how you are being treated hopefully this infection was drained and a small drain placed in your mouth to keep the site open this will allow the infection to drain into your mouth instead of tracking deeper into your tissues where it will be harder to treat or out onto your face where it can leave a scar i am not sure how the tooth is going to be fixed  is suspect a root canal  but if the infection does not clear soon with antibiotics i would recommend it be evaluated for extraction before bigger problems develop
451,this this is indicative that there is an active infection is present in the mouth the fact that the infection is draining indicates that your body is mounting a response to the infection as the pus is a collection of white blood cells that have come to the site of the infection to fight it the fact that the infection is draining into the mouth lessens the possibility that it will spread deeper into the tissues once the source of the infection is removed the combination of the your bodys natural defense mechanisms and the antibiotics should adequately fight the infection you need to take antibiotics for 7 to 10 days to get the proper benefit it is not unusual to not be able to drain an infection early in the process there may not be any pus white blood cells yet instead the swelling is due to cellulitis which is a diffuse accumulation of fluids in the infected tissue even though there is no pus  i will typically try to surgically enter the infected area an place a drain for a few days this does two thing first it creates a pathway to direct future drainage away from deeper tissues and vital structures secondly  there are some bacterial that cannot live in the presence of oxygen by draining the area we are introducing more oxygen deeper into the tissues to help kill these anaerobic bacteria
452,cracked cracked teeth are a challenge to diagnose an endodontist is a good place to start  as they see this routinely a tooth sleuth helps or a bite adjustment  and if so it likely will need a crown and maybe even a root canal
453,if if symptoms are not improving or ameliorated within one week despite conservative measures such as a neti pot  sinus irrigation and decongestants  you probably should be seen if the pain is progressing  or the drainage is purulent  malodorous and puslike you should be seen sooner for initiation of antibiotic therapy a neti pot will not treat an infectious cause for sinonasal complaints  it merely removes particulate and secretory matter  and often affords symptomatic relief for mild congestive inflammatory symptoms
454,depends on the cause many things can cause calluses some reasons that one may develop a callus include: viral infections warts  friction  pressure  repedetive trauma  and a limitation of joint motion some genetic conditions may also cause people to develop calluses on the hands and the feet treatment depends on the cause of the problem have it evaluated by a professional and get the appropriate treatment

462,odds are low most doctors think tumor until proven otherwise if your doctors are not thinking tumor  they are probably confident there is no tumor many other causes need to be considered infection  toxicity  hypertension  metabolic imbalance  migraine variant all must be considered

477,unusual this unusual follow up with surgeon

488,jaw pain you refer to previous infection with your wisdom tooth even though it seems fine  your jaw pain could reflect a problem with that wisdom tooth  such as a cyst or an infection in the jaw bone i would recommend you see an oral and maxillofacial surgeon in consultation to determine what the problem is and what would be in your best interest good luck
489,need more testing a noncontrast ct is a good screening exam for many conditions  but may not be as sensitive as mri you should be examined by a neurologist  and if he feels that it is warranted  a contrast mri study will afford a more precise diagnosis
490,possibly symptoms like these are best deterimed by a thorough evaluation by your physician based on his her findings  a treatment plan can be developed to help you
491,joint dysfunction your left tmj likely has medial to the midline displacement of the cartilage disc this allows the joint to be further up in the socket  hence the jaw shift the noise is the cartilage disc snapping back into place when opening without examination the growth cannot be commented on  so a visit to dentist or dermatologist is warranted
492,yes sentinel node biopsy can be done prior to breast surgery for a variety if reasons  such as before neoadjuvant chemotherapy to stage patients before mastectomy to determine if radiation is needed or reconstruction can be done  etc it is not commonly done to help decide between lumpectomy and mastectomy  so it is important to review how the sln results would impact your decision
493,breast cancer multiple clinical trials over decades show that lumpectomy alone is not adequate treatment for most not all patients  because there is often more cancer cells in the breast  beyond the lump
494,nasal congestion yes this is possible you should see a doctor for an examination and proper treatment
495,kneecap irritation if the pain is anterior it sounds like patellofemoral pain or cartilage wear under kneecap if it is at the joint line may be meniscus tear if no pain or clicking or catching in the knee sounds like the former

497,yes symptoms of lupus and rheumatoid arthritis can have similarities as well as differences nonetheless  it is possible to have either despite having a negative ra or lupus test no medical test is ever 100% accurate every time as there are false positives and false negatives in medicine  we have a saying  we are treating patients  not lab results however  keep exploring other poss diagnoses

503,less likely typically skin cancer changes  size  color  shape etc it is worth to see a skin doctor to confirm
504,right leg only if i understand  the abnormal findings are in only one leg could be a mono neuritis multiplex  but how about a lesion in the sciatic nerve such as a piriformis syndrome diabetics can get metabolic unilateral radiculopathies amyotrophies a search for the true location and causation can be indeed very fruitful
505,sinus infection this could be a number of things from the flu  to a cold to a sinus infection if you also have a specific tooth that is hurting  it could be infected as well you probably would be best seen by your physician if the symptoms worsen or are not better in a day or two unless you have the toothache and then your dentist could take care of it
506,yes snoring @ 2 is a bit unusual  will likely get worse as the tonsils  adenoids grow faster than the kid at this age if you notice pauses >10 seconds in snoring  the kid naps a lot during the day when the other kids are playing  it is time to pursue an ent evaluationthe iron issue is unrelated but could aggravate the symptoms

514,mole pathologists do not usually miss melanoma  sometimes difficult lesions are hard to classify however in your case the proper therapy depends on the clinical and pathologic diagnosis if the lesion was normal  no further therapy is needed if the lesion was a dysplastic nevus  it should be reexcised depending on the severity of the dysplasia excision is the usual treatment it is not excessive
515,elevate your leg swelling may persist for an extended period if the cellulitis was severe add an ace wrap as well
516,swelling as stated it could be normal and it could be dvt  the right thing to do is see your surgeon to get it checked

520,small risk the risk is delayed by about 15 to 20 years but even after 20 years  the risk is extremely small obviously  we dont want to get cts for no reason  but if you need one  i would not worry about a tumor afterwards
521,no a simple breast cyst or cyst with a single thin septation is very common and does not require biopsy or follow up if it has a more suspicious feature such a internal nodule  thick septation  etc  then biopsy would be preferable to follow up if a breast cyst is benign in appearance  it can still be therapeutically drained under ultrasound guidance to relieve symptoms
522,hard knocks of life as long as he is acting normal  i wouldnt worry use cold compresses to reduce the swelling
523,yes the failure rate of any antibiotic in otitis media runs around 5% for 1st treatment cycle with increasing failure rates for each successive round for that infection it may have worked initially while another resistant germ moved in  started a new infection recheck  retreatment may be needed  or the fever could be from another issue
524,see doctor it is not possible to tell what this is from brief description  coukd be cyst with opening or you coukd have 2 separate things in same area dermatologist will diagnose and remove if necessary
525,residual nail when toe pain persists after ingrown toenail removal  i am suspicious whether a nail spicule was left even the best doctor can sometimes miss a small nail fragment another possibility is infection  either of the skin or underlying bone either way  have it checked by your podiatristdont play doctor

527,yes changing position can cause an infection if the surrounding skin tissue is not clean
528,depend on what it is you need to get more evaluation definitely  a repeat mammogram should be done as well as an ultrasound of the breast biopsy to the mass will be the best thing to really tell you what the nodule is whether it is malignant or benign judging from the size  if this were a malignant nodule providing there is no evidence of spreading anywhere it is curable you need to know first what it is
529,just observe your symptoms are common after a mild closed head injury i assume you had a normal ct of the head during your hospital stay avoid strenuous activity and slow down until your symptoms resolve if the symptoms worsen  change significantly of persist for more than 710 days  i would recommend that you follow up with your doctor and consider a repeat ct of the head
530,in general nothing creatine is highly touted supplement used as a performance enhancer in general  any such ped carries some risk  even over the counter i recommend you not take anythingeat well  maybe add more protein and be cautious with carbs  and stay wellhydrated you can get strength and mass with a good  welldesigned workout without supplements
531,oxygen oxygen helps cluster headaches if that is what u have
532,probably not tumor the chances that you have a brain tumor after four months after a negative had scanned are very very low the headaches and symptoms yore feeling may be simple migraine headaches unrelated to any tumor it is worth your time to see a neurologist to evaluate the headaches if they continue
533,not typical if its your first time taking trazedone  that would be my first suspect if not  it could be the zoloft  or just coincidence headache is not one of the common side effects of zoloft

537,xrays  maybe mri start with a visit to your primary care provider xrays of the lower leg may be appropriate  depending on the history and physical exam findings a sports medicine or orthopedics consult may also be useful if more imaging is necessary  an mri  or possibly a bone scan or ct would be more appropriate than pet
538,really a pimple the question is whether its really a pimple i you are worried that you may have been exposed to an std  seek care from your gynecologist for a thorough examination  testing and a good conversation about your risk factors consider the choices you are making in your sexual expression always honor and respect yourself you are worth it

541,many possibilities all my colleagues gave you reasonable possibilities and i agree with them what is important is that you should be feeling better each day and the dentist who actually extracted the tooth should be the best one to know what is the most likely cause of your pain and about how long it should take to go away if not  consider seeing another dentist for second opinion
542,meniscus you may have a meniscus tear consult your surgeon to see if thats a possibility

545,botox you may want to consider having your doctor headache specialist see if botox can be approved for your migraine headaches if it works you could have significantly less migraines for at least 34 months at a time many times peoples migraines are cut in half if not more the use of your oral migraine prevention medications and abortives are much more helpful and reduce occurrences even better
546,may need orthotics see a podiatrist for a recommendation on if orthotics could be right for you if you want to try an overthecoubter product first  try spenco total support http:  wwwspencocom products footcare totalsupportinsoles insoles i would try this before surgery
547,usually your muscles most often at that age  mechanical strains and related conditions it band  patellofemoral syndrome  muscle pulls etc are to blame  particularly in patients with high loads  eg athletes  the obese much more rare are rheumatologic or serious orthopedic conditions these problems are much easier to diagnose through examination a good primary or sports med provider should be able to sort it out
548,leave it alone baby acne is felt to be triggered by babies high level of maternal hormone levels that sustained the pregnancy  prepaired for breast feeding clamping the cord cuts off new hormone input  but leaving the wet spa of pregnancy puts baby in contact with skin irritants and germs the process accelerates for a while before peaking  the intensity varies eventually the hormones  acne are gone
549,probably ok it is unlikely that jeans can ever create the degree of compression needed to affect circulation  and we in fact use compression to help treat patients with dvt
550,not tmj tmj unrelated to swollen lymph nodes see ent surgeon to work up swollen nodes possible to have concurrent but unrelated tmj problem
551,see below just because you have false teeth doesnt mean for a second you couldnt have tmj dissorders in fact it is very possible if you dentures are old and worn out then you are overoccluding and can cause stresses that are unnatural and damaging to those jointsthough this may not be the cause of your prob  it would be a good idea to see your dental provider for a check up

2871,many causes some common causes 1 bulging disc 2 diabetes 3 b12 anemia alcohol 4 medication side effect 5 nerve degeneration 6 poor circulation
2872,try embolization there are many options for fibroids  but relatively few for adenomyosis if hormonal therapies dont work the choices are limited hysterectomy is curative  but difficult to consider in a young woman there is emerging evidence that embolization can provide good results for adenomyosis as well as fibroids and allow uterine preservation and at least a chance of fertility
2873,check w your rheum having 4 negative joint aspirations makes gout less likely other multi joint problems poly articular arthropathies may not show up on rheumatoid panels  though a general inflammation test such as an esr or crp will normally be elevated you should get a diagnosis bc many good medications are available to treat rheumatologic diseases today
2874,right you are right uric acid stones dont show up on xray  ct scan but on ultrasound only
2875,unlikely hopefully you are not a smoker as this has the highest risk for affecting spine fusion rates using bone from your iliac crest region will have the highest fusion rate some people tend to have more disc degeneration than others this also tends to be genetic sometimes a fusion will accelerate adjacent level spine changes but it is very unlikely to leave you paralyzed by itself
2876,rash can you send a picture
2877,cant tell the test you stated above is a thyroid ultrasound it is not a scan you cant tell if something is hot or cold definitively on a thyroid ultrasound you need a thyroid scan using radioactive iodine to know if something is hot or cold if your tsh was normal  you probably didnt have a scan for a nodule that small 3 mm
2878,need immediate care women often have atypical symptoms in case of heart disease  including heart attack the symptoms you describe are worrisome and warrant immediate attention please go to the nearest emergency department to rule out a serious issue
2879,not to worry very common to see swollen glands on the neck areas like you described normally self limiting unless glands turn red  hot   tender with purplish discoloration  then it needs to be treated with antibiotics the elbow might be something separate from the neck have physician take a look to make a diagnosis  hard to say without seeing it
2880,couple possibilities could be recurrent sinus problems or muscle tension headache  but the key may be the feelings of tightness  temple pain these are most commonly seen with muscle tension hathe cause  however  is likely coming from your neck called cervicogenic haa good history  phys ex  esp osteopathic handson exam might find the cause esp if jointmuscle  provide treatment via osteopathic manipulation
2881,you should be concerned lumps should always be checked it could very well be benign  but you have to make sure i will usually recommend taking a small biopsy of tissue so that a pathologist can look at the contents under a microscope this was you know for sure what it is
2882,possibly risk factors for heart disease play a role and without knowing them  difficult to tell if you are a woman >50  in my book all bets are of heart disease in women is very difficult to diagnose ahead of time you ladies are tricky you are doing the right thing right now pop an aspirin on your way in
2883,bacteria in urethra most utis are result of bacteria enering the urethra and working their way up to the prostae  bladder anthing causing urinary stasis or obstruction  like man enlarged prostae or urthral stricture will promote a uti chlamydia and mycoplasma can be sexually transmitted and cause utis uncircumcised  particulary men with poor hygiene  are more likely to get utis than those circumcised circumcised
2884,yes but yes as long as they dont cause drowsiness and thus affecting your alertness i usually suggest to patients to take something like fexofenadine allegra 180 mg during the day and whatever works for them in the evening zyrtec causes some drowsiness in slightly over 10% of the people and benadryl over 30% in my own experience
2885,no pain is key sometimes swelling in the foot can take six months or longer to resolve
2886,discuss plans it sounds like you dont agree wih his her plan its very important for everybodys sake that each party agree with the proposed plan disagreements can be perceived as lack of commitment and so on
2887,2 at a time frankly this is dumb the reason for two at a time relates to insurance payment each lesion is reduced in pay by half that means you have to go through more surgical events better to just pay for the treatment all at once one day one recovery these are usually not sebaceous chats but rather pilar cysts that are easy to remove antibiotics over prescribed surgery is the answer
2888,no permanent removal involves surgery  although there is a 15% risk of recurrence aspiration is less invasive and can be tried but also has a risk of recurrence
2889,and u called ur md call your doctor you might have ruptured the cyst  less likely twisted the ovary  or unrelated issue  like appendicitis it can be very painful get examined again get another sono  or other appropriate test
2890,insect bite the response to a sting or bite from insects is variable and depends on a variety of factors most bites and stings result in pain  swelling  redness  and itching to the affected area the skin may be broken and become infected if the bite area is scratched if not treated properly  these local infections may become severe and cause a condition known as cellulitis the vie may be infected see doc
2891,great for any teen with osgood schlatter  non impact and no jumping or running exercise is critical keep quad muscles strong  and stretch the quads in addition to swimming and biking
2892,likely i would not chance it very risky and if it is passed on  its for life no cure
2893,rash rashes and skin lesions are impossible to diagnose without seeing them however the distribution suggests scabies you need to be seen and evaluated
2894,you may need to be in a surgical shoe or boot doubt you need a cast
2895,cancer do you have an actual diagnosis of breast cancer from a biopsy or are you describing what you see and feel breast infection can be firm tender and red but the rare condition of an inflammatory breast cancer can be a serious condition environmental conditions do not cause sudden cancer formation  but infections can be related to unclean situations
2896,complicated your bf may be colonized with this staph on his skin and in his nose and back of throat if you are intimate the chances are that you too are colonized that does not necessarily mean that you will become infected that requires a complex interaction of sites in which infection can occur  your innate immunity and other factors
2897,then it is too late early intestinal and colon cancers  gi  are asymtamatic  wbc not useful   tumor markers like cea is mostly used for follow up for a recurrence of disease besides awareness only way for early detection is visit to your doctor  stool for occult blood  and endoscopy to achive the cure
2898,yes children should always have the best corrected vision possible so their visual system develops correctly please seek the care of a pediatric ophthalmologist for help and goo luck
2899,unlikely much more likely that you are sensitive to caffeine if it persists  talk to your doctor
2900,2 to 3 while on warfarin the goal protime inr is between 2 and 3
2901,could be permanent i agree with dr smith it can take months wearing compression stockings right away will help but it is essential to wear the stockings for at least wo years to help to decrease your chance that the swelling might never go away
2902,her eyes may be dry a year after surgery it is possible that her eyes are dry and she is over producing tears to compensate for the dryness try using artificial tears to see if this helps
2903,myomectomy there are drugs that usually shrink fibroids somewhat  but no foods that i have learned of if myomectomy is needed  i suggest trying to have it done laparoscopically there are gyn specialists that will do this and there is less scarring
2904,see a doctor he may have a nerve impingement
2905,the t1c stage means it is bigger than some clear indication for antihormone tamoxifen anastrazole i might consider oncotype testing tissue to discern benefit from chemo  but if you would not take it regardless of results  dont waste your money
2906,radiation burns radiation therapy causes a type of burn resulting in injury hopefully cancer cells are killed  but normal tissue heals with some effects of tissue scarring
2907,pet could help a pet scan could be helpful as any malignancy greater than 1 cm in size should be hot small tumors can be behind folds or stool or be missed on colonoscopy for other reasons a small intestinal cancer would not be found on upper or lower endoscopy if the doctors are certain that the tumor is not a primary liver tumor  a pet scan should definitely be done
2908,possible chalazion if it involves the lower eyelid not the upper cheek it is probably a chalazion which is inflammation of a clogged meibomian oil gland treatment consists of warm compresses and massage and surgical drainage if no resolution after about a month if the surrounding skin area becomes inflamed a preseptal cellulitis could be occurring which would require systemic antibiotics
2909,small difference in balloon sinuplasty we just dilate the natural sinus openings with a balloon there is no cutting or removal of tissue in endoscopic sinus surgery we usually remove various blockages along the sinus openings and widen these openings so they do not block up balloon can really only be used in certain patients with mild chronic sinusitis  no polyps  no ethmoid sinus disease and no septal deviati
2910,absolutely i am sorry to hear about your prior experience do not lose hope you can definitely get pregnant with only one tube but  when you achieve pregnancy consider that there is a risk for another ectopic pregnancy for the sames reasons known or unknown that you had one before you will need early monitoring and ultrasounds to make sure that the next pregnancy is in the uterus
2911,sounds like it your description sure sounds like a sleep apnea problem you need to see your doctor asap and hopefully get referred for a sleep study so treatment can be initiated dont hesitate
2912,yes if you have no pvd or cad
2913,probably the nerves to both your chin and tongue usually sit right under and right next to a wisdom tooth it is very unusual for it to spontaneously produce numbness in either or even both of those places id go visit an oral surgeon and have it checked right away
2914,your symptoms are not consistent with the surgery you had in 2009 i suggest you consult with your pcp
2915,no the lip will not be paralyzed however  there is low risk of lower lip numbness or tongue numbness from a wisdom tooth extraction the sensation usually feels heavy
2916,it depends if you indeed a had a full hysterectomy  e g  had your cervix removed  b have no history of prior cin  and c and there is no histologic evidence for cin in the hysterectomy specimen  then you dont need a pap smear however  so long as you have a cervix  or if you have had previous cin on a pap test and or colposcopy then you need a pap smear
2917,neck and vision should have checked out sounds like vascular problem possibly from post vertebral artery
2918,allergic sinusitis you could be having allergies try benadryl or claritin
2919,no omega 3 fatty acids are useful for lowering triglycerides  when they are very high >500 mg dl and perhaps for cardiovascular risk reduction at lower doses 1 gm day   as a replacement for appropriate fish containing omega 3 epa and dha in those who do not or cannot eat enough fish they do not raise hdl  exercise  weight loss   smoking cessation  saturated fat can raise hdl
2920,depends i operate on one eyed patients every week although risks associated with routine cataract surgery are low  i always counsel my patients that it is not worth taking the risk if you are not having trouble if your vision is affecting your lifestyle  and you are not able to function as you would like to  it may be worth the risk discuss this with your surgeon
2921,consider broken bone a swollen injured foot can be a sprain it can also be a broken bone in the foot which needs to be stabilized to heal in the right position if you recall no injury  there are many other important reasons for a swollen foot get checked a foot fracture if not properly treated can cause trouble walking for the rest of your life
2922,consent normally most doctors dont verbally warn you about all the risks that are involved with your percedure  but you have probebly signed a consent form in this consent form usualy a list of possible complication which includes temporary or permenant numbing of areas in your case most likely a temporary but make sure you communicate with your doctor
2923,chronic sinusitis the answer is to manage your chronic sinusitis if you are congested your mouth breathing will dry out the membranes check our website at wwwnwnasalsinuscom for more information
2924,have it evaluated pain may last a long time following a foot or ankle injury an xray can show if there is an underlying fracture you may have a soft tissue injury if it is just a sprain and may have damaged the muscle  tendon  or ligaments in the area have it evaluated by a professional and get the appropriate treatment
2925,yes yesbut repeating the xrays at two weeks post injury to confirm or deny the presence of a scaphoid fracture is still recommended we dont want to needlessly immobilize a wrist 
2926,clindamycin et al clindamycin and keflex are some common antibiotics used for oral surgery however  keflex can have some crossallergy if you are allergic to penicillin
2927,glasses or contacts you can be corrected it with glasses or contact
2928,unsure not that i know of some cysteine have been known to resolve spontaneously but surgery is the definitive answer aspiration has a high risk of recurrence
2929,possibly there is a small risk of retinal tears breaks holes detachment after cataract surgery some retinal holes are present preoperatively as well especially in nearsighted individuals
2930,you are safe be careful but it appears your on the right path with maintaing good glycemic control target aics leass than 60 and you are in good stead
2931,collaboratively  yes with all due respect to dr bardawil  classical homeopathy does have a place in treating fibroids surgery may indeed be needed  depending on the extent of growth still  there are over 100 remedies known to shrink fibroids  aurum  its relatives is just one for best success  see a trained classical homeopath who can perceive the most indicated remedy   collaborate effectively w doctors
2932,paresthesia this is most likely related to paresthesia a condition associated with nerve damage your case appears to be of mild damage and does not require surgery after 4 years i would nit expect for you to have a change in symptoms
2933,yes pregnancy can result from intercourse on any day of a womans cycle you should use contraception regularly  unless you wish to get pregnant
2934,see a md it is not likely to be cancer but have a md evaluate the area to be certain
2935,not always often times a cam walking boot will do
2936,no symptom no treat 2550% women develop benign uterine fibroid muscle tumors if you dont have symptoms heavy periods  pain then no intervention is needed if you do then many options exist to help improve them: myomectomy  hysterectomy laparoscopic  uterine artery ablation  and hysteroscopic myomectomy
2937,consider wearing one with less pressure support hose are made with various pressure gradients
2938,not uncommon like many parts of the body  the knee is a complex structure with small tolerances when you have meniscal repair on one side of the knee  this may produce some slight mechanical changes in the knee with walking and other activities which can result in additional stress on the other side of the knee this stress may also produce another meniscal tear discuss the findings with your doctor
2939,possibly should be evaluated by your physician  promptly
2940,probably not a kidney stone on the move will not spare you pain during dayit hurts day or night since you only experience pain at night  something else is causing your pain kub is a so so test for kidney stone  but your pain pattern does not fit it is difficult to tell what you have based on the limited info provided please consult doc for reevaluation and possible additional testing good luck
2941,nerve damage your description sounds like you sustained nerve damage as a result of the surgery it may get better but some numbness may persist permanently
2942,not at all it would be advisable to try to lose general weight in order to have a smaller chance of the hernia conf back doing a tummy tuck or liposuction is not a smart move and may increase risk of infection most hernias are repaired using mesh and if you had an infection due to fat removal  your mesh can also get infected and may need to be removed
2943,lasik causes dryness research has shown that it may take 69 months for nerves to reconnect  with any lasik flap prk or epilasik do not cut through these nerves dry eye lasts until those nerves reconnect this is why patients with preexisting dry eye are not great candidates for lasik
2944,treatment xray will be taken treatment will be aimed at taken weight off the area in order for the none to heal typically a walking cast boot will be utilized fracture healing is 6to 8 weeks
2945,yes usually you can see tumors that have spread to the lungs on an xray however  you can have stage 4 cancer without there being any cancer in the lungs i had a patient once who had stage 4 kidney cancer and her lungs were totally fine
2946,doctors radiologist is most likely correct describing your abnormalities ordering physician reads ct scan too talk to him
2947,same disease interstitial lung disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are different terms for the same disease fibrosis means scar tissue in lay terms for unknown reasons fibrous tissue begins to replace normal lung causing difficulty breathing at present there is no effective treatment although it is an intense area of research and many new drugs are being studied
2948,unfortunately  unfortunately  the natural lens of the eye becomes less flexible as we age this loss of lens flexibility causes decreased near vision  or presbyopia typically  presbyopia progresses during the patients forties and fifties a monovision contact lens or reading glasses will correct the presbyopia
2949,lasik lasik can correct most levels of nearsightedness and astigmatism see a lasik surgeon for a screening and more information
2950,possibly difficult to answer not knowing the details of the tumor  location  size  etc but there is a role for chemoemboliztion to slow growth  potentially palliate  or even bridge to transplant it is reasonable to ask your treating medical and surgical oncologist about the different options and their outcomes for treatment
2951,dry eye i would try punctal plugs and continuing frequent artificial tears see an eye doctor
2952,lasik if stable if your prescription has not changed much in last 12 years  then you should do well with lasik  as long as you have a through eye exam and computerized measurements of your corneal curvature and thickness  and all is normal preferably the exam should be done and all testing reviewed by the ophthalmologist   eye surgeon who will perform the procedure make sure to get all your questions answered
2953,lactose lactose intolerance is the lack of an intestinal enzyme called lactase and is the inability to digest lactose  the sugar found in milk and other dairy products babies are born with the lactase enzyme and most lactose intolerance does not occur until age 3 or older if at all symptoms can be bloating  cramps  diarrhea  nausea and poor growth in children some races such as asians and african americans are more susceptable to lactose intolerance than caucasians 2%3% of infants have milk allergy and the good news is that many of them outgrow in by 35 years of age milk allergy is actually the bodys immune system recognizing cow milk protein in the intestines as a foreign substance and causing symptoms like loose  sometimes bloody stool  irritability  vomiting and food refusal this usually occurs in the first few months of life the incidence of milk allergy is lower in breast fed babies than formula fed babies  but some babies react to the cows milk protein transferred through the mothers milk from the dairy in the mothers diet breast feeding is best and you can continue if you restrict or eliminate milk and dairy products from your diet just make sure you are getting enough calcium from nondairy sources legal disclaimer: i am providing this general and basic information as a public service and my response to this question does not constitute a doctorpatient relationship for any additional information  advice  or specific concerns  please speak with your own physician the information provided is current as of the date of the answer entry
2954,very rare usually these cancers are low grade and have good prognosis the two most common in this age group are transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder tccb and papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential punlmp given that these are so rare  it is important to have both a pediatric oncologist and urologist involved with treatment decisions and followup plan
2955,thanks thanks for your question yes  there are some infections that can be contracted by having unprotected sex such as a urinary tract infection  bacterial vaginosis  hepatitis c  herpes oral to skin and warts skin to skin human papillovirus or genital warts can go undetectable for many years  but can be passed on through unprotected sex also  by having unprotected sex  you are at high risk for pregnancy talk to your health care provider abut birth control and safe sex
2956,this this is a very delicate situation that you need to thoroughly discuss with your doctor the reason that its a big decision for you is your age in regards to wheter or not you want more children it sounds like your fibroids have caused a lot of medical problems for you namely severe anemia and im sure pain if you are sure that you want no more children then the option of having a hysterectomy will be an easier one however if you do want more children  then there are other possible treatment options that can possiblity treat your fibroids while at the same time preserving your fertility
2957,not typical corneal abrasion is unusual but can occur and usually heals within a few days macular edema is more serious and is treated with nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drops macular pucker or epiretinal membranes can predispose to cystoid macular edema retinal examination prior to cataract surgery can identify eyes at risk unless the density of the cataract prevents an adequate retinal examination
2958,get it evaluated you will need to have it professionally evaluated you will need xrays taken to determine the location and orientation of the fragment if you have significant pain and your physician feels that removing the bone fragment will be beneficial  then you should consider having the fracture fragment removed
2959,lasik or prk in general  results for nearsightedness and regular astigmatism are very good with either treatment many people achieve excellent vision after these treatments it would be important to know why someone could not wear contacts  as in cases of irregular astigmatism where laser correction would not be an option
2960,a a lensectomy is essentially a premature cataract surgery  meaning your natural lens has not fully developed a cataract clounding of natural lens this can be an excellent option for patients in their late 50s early 60s who want to correct astigmatism and nearsightedness and avoid developing cataracts later if you are younger  you could consider lasik or prk everyone who lives long enough will develop cataracts  most during the 60s or 70s thus if you are closer to this age range  you might consider lensectomy  it is like one stop shopping correct vision and avoid cataract surgery the lenses today are advanced and can correct both astigmatism and nearsightedness there are even lenses that provide both distance and near vision  discuss with your surgeon the best option
2961,sleep apnea sleep apnea can cause depression decreased sex drive decreased attention  concetration  memory etc
2962,you you should have a ct scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a good look at the liver and spleen also make sure you get a cbc  if your white count is elevated then the lymph node should be investigated lastly  since you are a smoker and have had such a significant weight loss  a cxr is also a good idea best of luck
2963,could be many things enlargement of lymph node can be caused by many things like trauma irritation around the area  infection  bacterial  viral etc  autoimmune disease  cancer etc judging from the duration of your problem things like irritation trauma to the left upperarm arm pit ie shaving  boils  scratching over the skin on left arm etc can cause the enlargement of the lymph node there
2964,possible neuropathy depending on the affected nerves  symptoms of diabetic neuropathy can range from a numbness and tingling sensation  possibly a burning sensation  to an uncomfortable painful sensation of the extremities neuropathy may affect your digestive system  urinary tract  blood vessels and the heart for some people  the symptoms are mild for others  it can be painful and disabling
2965,an an ultrasound can suggest what it is bit is not definitive an ultrasound looks at fluid changes so for a cyst it is good to see the transition from the awl of the cyst to the inside fluid layer stll where it is can also influence the ultrasounds ability to discern detail ie behind a bone the sound waves may not get through as well while the tech may give someone preliminary info one really needs to wait for the formal report and for the ordering physician to review it and make sur the findings correspond and are relevant to the problem this last reason is why a lot of physicians surgeons are starting to do their own musculoskeletal ultrasound in their own office setting the ability for a surgeon who knows the anatomy primarily to see structures and do a relevant physical exam at the same time becomes of great value
2966,to to add to dr dyros answer  ms can affect the spinal cord as well as the brain  so if a brain mri was not conclusive but a spinal cord mri was not done  ms has certainly not been excluded as to whether autonomic neuropathy can be fatal  it is unusual but can happen  if low blood pressure affects the heart or brain  causing loss of consciousness which can then cause serious trauma depending on when it happens if you have syncope and fall you could injure yourself substantially usually the various manifestations of peripheral or autonomic neuropathy can be treated symptomatically with some benefit but the underlying disease process is often not treatable with current knowledge and technology
2967,cold foot if these are new symptoms that you are experiencing i would see a vascular doctor for further evaluation
2968,typically typically ingrown toe nails cause a localized infection of the skin surrounding the nail cellulitis which could eventually lead to an abscess if left untreated what you described sounds more like cellulitis the treatment for this is antibiotics the treatment for an abscess is the same  however in some case it may need to be opened and drained if your primary care doctor is not treating your problem then you should ask for a referral to a podiatrist foot doctor you also probably need the ingrown toe nail to be surgically removed best of luck
2969,hard hard to tell without a picture  but perhaps he has either eczema or molluscum contagiosum take a look at the picture below to see if it looks similar to molluscum if so  i would visit a dermatologist to confirm the diagnosis and discuss treatment options i hope that helps
2970,he he should take an antihistamine daily i e claritin  alavert  zyrtec in addition he should take a daily acid blocker like pepcid or prilosec also consider trying benadryl at night to see if this helps slow down the mucous production he should also avoid dairy products  as they tend to increase mucous production if he has not seen an allergist  he should go for allergy testing if he has certain allergies  this can contribute to his problem lastly  he needs a follow up appointment with the ent ear  nose  throat specialist for further work up and treatment plan
2971,yes there is also the hormonal class of medication
2972,there there are a wide variety of problems that occur in this area  including bakers cysts  meniscal tears  pcl tears  tendinitis  nerve injuries  popliteal artery aneurysms  and some growths most benign and some cancerous the best thing to do is to see an orthopaedic surgeon and have it examined and xrayed some problems will need mri there are a lot of important anatomical parts in that area and it should not be ignored
2973,yes in these cases radiation would be used as a palliative treatment as opposed to a curative one depending on the size  location  number of lesions  the patient s performance status  and other factors radiation can be a very effective treatment sometimes stereotactic body radiation can be used on the liver also  some patients may be candidates for microspheres treatment for the liver
2974,overdue if you havent had one for ten years yore overdue even if you havent had a cuts
2975,im im sorry your son is having so much trouble with this chest pain since he was diagnosed with a valve problem   and beta blockers were recommended as a potential treatment  i presume hes dealing with mitral valve prolapse mvp  which is usually a benign condition however  it can sometimes cause significant chest pain  and beta blockers might alleviate this discomfort if other causes of your sons chest pain have been ruled out his cardiology workup should have accomplished that  then a trial of preventive beta blocker therapy is reasonable he doesnt necessarily need to return home for that his cardiologist might be able to arrange appropriate treatment after consulting with the physician in north carolina keep in mind that beta blockers  like nearly all medications  can cause side effects  such as dizziness  fatigue  slowed heartbeat  and poor exercise tolerance talk to the cardiologist about the risks and benefits of beta blocker therapy if he feels comfortable prescribing medications without seeing your son again  then your son can continue his studies otherwise  you can bring him home for reevaluation ive attached a link that provides more information about mvp i hope things go well http:  wwwmedicinenetcom mitral_valve_prolapse articlehtm
2976,hello hello i cannot diagnose your condition however  with history of difficulty swallowing  swollen lymph nodes and generalized malaise  it would be prudent to get seen so that you can get a strepth test your medical provider may need to investigate more if those nodes dont start going down in size
2977,check with doctor the cipro should have covered a uti but sometimes resistant bacteria will not respond the amoxicillin might help but you are likely to get some diarrhea and possible yeast infections with all of the antibiotics
2978,trachea still cf the graft of new lungs does leave a trachea that still has the cf defect this can serve as a source of infection to the new lungs the new transplanted lungs though will not have cf disease
2979,overdue to see an orthopedic surgeon who specializes in ankle foot
2980,the the single most common cause of heel pain is plantar fasciitis  an inflammation of a ligament that begins in the heel but the typical scenario of plantar fasciitis is that it starts slowly  with good days  then bad days  then good days again  with the patient usually describing the pain as worst after rest  like that first step in the morning getting out of bed it usually takes months before patients seek medical help for plantar fasciitis if you cant even bear weight on your heel  i wonder if you have a stress fracture of your heel bone xrays hardly ever show such small little fractures  but the pain can be intense i would suggest an mri  with 3 mm cuts narrower than usual in order to pick up a tiny break stress fractures of the heel bone can be very frustrating for both doctor and patient assuming no other underlying medical problems that would cause heel pain and there are a number of them  getting an mri would be my best suggestion at this point i hope you feel better good luck
2981,yes you can consider blepharoplasty but your dry eye needs to be treated before the surgery
2982,get tested do i have std = get tested regardless of symptoms get a urinalysis and get treated with yeast infection at the same time
2983,research research varies in terms of when it is too late to improve vision in patients with lazy eye most eye doctors agree that the critical period of time to treat is between 4 and 9 years of age the problem is that lazy eye  which is actually called amblyopia  is a problem where the wiring between the eye and the brain does not form properly and once you are hard wired  it cant change if an eye wanders consistently  then surgery on the muscles can be performed to straighten out the eye
2984,a a rash with raised red bumps is called a maculopapular rash and can be caused by many  many things such as: food or drug allergy viral infections such as fifths disease  roseola  ebv  cmv  molluscum just to name a few insect bites such as fleas or scabies bacterial infection such as scarlet fever caused by strep medication reaction or it can be seen in very rare things such as: measles toxic shock syndrome kawasaki disease meningitis stevensjohnson syndrome rocky mountain spotted fever disease the list goes on and on the best thing to do is to call your childs doctor they may want to take a look to see what it may be odds are that if your child does not have a high fever or is not acting sick  then its probably nothing serious
2985,hello hello two issues jump out here first  you have seen the cadilac of bladder doctors a urologist and he has recommended this procedure second  asking doctors on line if you should get this surgery who have not met you  examined you physically  taken a history or looked at your specialty studies is like taking the option that is way below a vw bug the specialist visualized a large mass during your cystoscopy have you asked what the possibility is that those could be a cancerous lesion if it was my body  i would want to make sure that i didnt have cancer i cant make this important medical decision for you i suspect you are hoping that the problem will just go away but with the history you have provided  i think that not getting this procedure would be like playing russian roulette if you need to  pray about this but by all means  do take care
2986,hello hello i cant diagnose your symptoms however  it does sound a lot like podagra which is when the base of the big toe contains uric acid crystals if you have not been evaluated for possible gout  recommend that you do so in the mean time you might consider pain control through a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication like motrin hope your pain is relieved soon take care
2987,probably probably not there are certain anesthetics that can last 6 to 10 hours it depends on what your surgeon used can you call their office and ask take it easy the rest of the evening and in a short while you will start to get the feeling back
2988,it it may or may not worsen  but it will not improve without wearing correction perhaps contact lenses would be a better solution ask your eye doctor is this is possible
