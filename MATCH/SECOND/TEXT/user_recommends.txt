3257,[ui first started seeing dr carroll when we found we were expecting our first child 7 years ago  i have since had two more babies  also delivered by him  and have continued my care with him as my gynecologist  i have found his manner to be consistently calm  clear and professional  he always takes time to listen to your questions and gives clear  understandable responses  during my pregnancies  i felt very reassured when discussing my care and wishes for my deliveries with him that he heard and respected me  i have recommended him to several of my friends who have also been very happy with their care and their choice in having him deliver their children  if you are looking for a good doctor who listens and is trustworthy you've found him  udr carroll is amazing to say the least! he has delivered 2 out of my 3 children my first was a nightmare (delivered elsewhere) with my second and third  dr carroll calmed all of my fears and made me feel completely at ease during my appointments all of my questions were answered and i always felt like my needs were being met he listened and respected what i wanted with my prenatal care  delivery and after care\n\nduring both of my c-sections i felt completely at ease there weren't any complications and i didn't have any pain at all i was home from the hospital within 2 days both times i wouldn't go anywhere else! i recommend him any chance i get there isn't a better doctor!  u'i had a women doctor for my first two pregnancies and was a little nervous about having a male doctor  we were highly refered to dr brendan carroll by a co-worker  i have been pleased not only with his bedside manner  but he takes the time to listen and address your concerns without making you feel rushed  he also is very discreet when checking the feminin area  dr carroll is very professional and also very personal as well'  uwhen booking my first appt the receptionist said he has very good bedside manner & she was right! he's very calm & knowledgeable & takes all the time you need to answer questions we even found our awesome pediatrician b/c of him we recently moved out of state & are greatly missing him & our pediatrician but he went out of his way to get recommendations from his contacts in our new area for both!  u'i have been visiting dr carroll for all of my obstetric and gynecology appointments for over 8 years now i appreciate his friendly and relaxed manner when i am in his office  he always takes his time explaining anything medically relevant  that might seem confusing or unclear him and his team go the extra mile for their patients  and that is a quality that is hard to find in a doctor nowadays!'  u'dr carroll is a wonderful doctor  he has a very warm and caring personality that makes you feel comfortable and at ease  when i became pregnant after having an ovarian cyst removed  he took extra precautions to make sure the pregnancy went as smoothly as possible  he is patient  supportive and clearly explains medical issues  i highly recommend him!']
