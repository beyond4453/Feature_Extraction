yes & qualified yes local recurrence in a previously radiated breast makes reconstruction riskier and more difficult if there is marked skin thickening and fibrosis or deformity  flap reconstruction is probably a better choice if those findings do not pertain  methods using expanders and prostheses plus allpoderm (which require no donor site)can be tried first  saving a flap as a backupor lifeboat operation,212557,2,39971,12319274,"3,460",university of texas medical branch school of medicine  tx,32years,"[10038590, 10538896, 10049331, 10003512, 10005496, 10002162, 12229824, 11682263, 10014344, 10058367, 10014285, 10005276, 10005209, 10000408, 10010426, 10052978, 12716366, 11184711, 10004464, 10014592]","1,502,514",[u'liposuction'  u'facelift'  u'eyelid surgery'  u'eye lift'  u'gynecomastia'  u'breast reconstruction'  u'deep plane face lift'  u'genital plastic surgery'  u'arm lift'  u'breast lift'  u'tummy tuck'  u'fat transfer'  u'facelift'  u'breast enlargement surgery'],college: ut  austin  ba microbiology med school: utmb  galveston general surgery: und plastic surgery: lsu craniofacial/ congenital surgery: dr millard  md and sa wolfe @ u miami private practice for 22 years  inverness  fl,[u'great doctor consistently gives thoughtful  insightful and expert advice'  u'good doc w/ broad knowledge base'],3,breast surgery,512,[u'breast cancer'  u'cancer'  u'gamma rays'  u'radioactive'  u'irradiation'  u'surgery'  u'breast radiation'  u'lumpectomy'  u'female health'  u'breast reconstruction'],if cancer comes back in the same breast after having a breast-sparing surgery  will i need a mastectomy then? will i be able to have breast reconstruction even though i have had radiation?

manner makes them feel comfortable and relaxed dr wright is a perfectionist known for his beautiful cosmetic dentistry  and carefully chooses a restoration color that matches each patient’s tooth color so closely that the tooth looks new again he is also a mercury-free  biological (holistic) dentist who practices the safe removal of mercury fillings the guiding philosophies of biological dentistry are: 1 first do no harm (hippocrates) 2 the health of the mouth and the body are connected by seeking out and working to understand the root cause of illness  the biological practitioner helps the patient achieve health stability and wellness  as well as reduce the need for avoidable and costly treatment? dr wright is a long time accredited member of the international association of oral & medicine toxicology (iaomt) and the international academy of biological dentistry & medicine (iabdm) he uses their recommended mercury removal methods for biological dentists to protect patients from inhaling mercury vapors (hg) or coming in contact with any mercury particulate during the mercury removal process dr wright uses mercury air filtration in his office for additional protection against toxic mercury vapors after using the correct biological dental protocol to remove the decayed tooth material  he restores the tooth with the least toxic  most biologically compatible material available today dr wright put himself through college at illinois benedictine and northeastern university by working full-time while attending classes full-time he then went on to study dentistry and receive a doctorate of dental surgery (dds) from the highly acclaimed marquette university in milwaukee  wisconsin  graduating top in his class with hundreds of hours of extra training  dr wright is always updating his knowledge base by attending classes and learning the latest dental advancements and technology dr wright has also studied at the prestigious dawson center for advanced dental study in st petersburg  florida the dawson center provides excellent post-graduate training in a laboratory-style environment it was at the dawson center that he learned how to properly custom fabricate and fit occlusal appliances  known as night guards these appliances give patients relief from temporomandibular joint syndrome (tmj) or temporomandibular disorder (tmd) tmj and tmd are the most common causes of facial pain other than a toothache dr wright has studied advanced techniques in bite equilibration” this allows patients to function better  preserve their teeth and sometimes eliminate their pain after more than 13 years in his own private practice in chicago  dr wright took additional advanced training for one year with master dentist dr paul saniuk  whose work  skills and ethics he had admired for years dr saniuk is one of the most knowledgeable doctors in the country on full mouth reconstruction  equilibration and various other dental treatment techniques this was a special opportunity for dr wright to learn advanced clinical skills in a one-to-one setting while treating patients with dr saniuk upon completion of this one year of advanced training  dr saniuk remarked  “i marvel that dr wright is such a natural  and how quickly and completely he mastered these techniques he is a true artist” an avid interest in the mechanics of the human mouth led dr wright to study the theories behind the development of the invisible braces technique of teeth straightening  known today around the world as the invisalign® method he has attended multiple classes with two senior invisalign instructors  and is one of the select dentists in the country trained and certified by the invisalign corporation to treat patients using this unique orthodontic system after practicing in the chicago area for 15 years  dr wright  along with his wife debby  decided to open four seasons dental spa in las vegas  nevada their hope was to create the best  most relaxing  biological dental experience in the world for their patients they are committed to pioneering the paradigm shift from fear of going to the dentist  to a relaxing  spa-like experience to which patients look forward dr wright feels strongly that if parents enjoy and look forward to their visits to four seasons dental spa  their children will look forward to the time when they  too  can go to the dental spa dr wright is a conservative biological dentist  and believes in using the least invasive non-surgical approach first  which is traditional scaling and root planing (deep cleaning) when periodontal disease is present  and periodontal pockets measure in excess of 4 mm  the traditional practice is to remove the plaque  calculus and tartar debris from the teeth and provide oral hygiene instruction in addition to this  he treats periodontal disease with a state-of-the art laser to avoid gum surgery for most periodontal disease combining state of the art technology with a conservative biological dental approach  laser energy is applied to inactivate periodontal disease if the disease has advanced and osseous (gum) surgery is necessary  four season's patients are able to have their gum surgery at four seasons dental spa under the expert care of a board certified periodontist  having achieved the level of diplomate today's advanced surgical procedures can cure defects  thereby reducing the patient's susceptibility to periodontal disease in addition to the iaomt  dr wright is also a member of the international academy of biological

his caring chair-side manner makes them feel comfortable and relaxed dr wright is a perfectionist known for his beautiful cosmetic dentistry  and carefully chooses a restoration color that matches each patient’s tooth color so closely that the tooth looks new again he is also a mercury-free  biological (holistic) dentist who practices the safe removal of mercury fillings the guiding philosophies of biological dentistry are: 1 first do no harm (hippocrates) 2 the health of the mouth and the body are connected by seeking out and working to understand the root cause of illness  the biological practitioner helps the patient achieve health stability and wellness  as well as reduce the need for avoidable and costly treatment? dr wright is a long time accredited member of the international association of oral & medicine toxicology (iaomt) and the international academy of biological dentistry & medicine (iabdm) he uses their recommended mercury removal methods for biological dentists to protect patients from inhaling mercury vapors (hg) or coming in contact with any mercury particulate during the mercury removal process dr wright uses mercury air filtration in his office for additional protection against toxic mercury vapors after using the correct biological dental protocol to remove the decayed tooth material  he restores the tooth with the least toxic  most biologically compatible material available today dr wright put himself through college at illinois benedictine and northeastern university by working full-time while attending classes full-time he then went on to study dentistry and receive a doctorate of dental surgery (dds) from the highly acclaimed marquette university in milwaukee  wisconsin  graduating top in his class with hundreds of hours of extra training  dr wright is always updating his knowledge base by attending classes and learning the latest dental advancements and technology dr wright has also studied at the prestigious dawson center for advanced dental study in st petersburg  florida the dawson center provides excellent post-graduate training in a laboratory-style environment it was at the dawson center that he learned how to properly custom fabricate and fit occlusal appliances  known as night guards these appliances give patients relief from temporomandibular joint syndrome (tmj) or temporomandibular disorder (tmd) tmj and tmd are the most common causes of facial pain other than a toothache dr wright has studied advanced techniques in bite equilibration” this allows patients to function better  preserve their teeth and sometimes eliminate their pain after more than 13 years in his own private practice in chicago  dr wright took additional advanced training for one year with master dentist dr paul saniuk  whose work  skills and ethics he had admired for years dr saniuk is one of the most knowledgeable doctors in the country on full mouth reconstruction  equilibration and various other dental treatment techniques this was a special opportunity for dr wright to learn advanced clinical skills in a one-to-one setting while treating patients with dr saniuk upon completion of this one year of advanced training  dr saniuk remarked  “i marvel that dr wright is such a natural  and how quickly and completely he mastered these techniques he is a true artist” an avid interest in the mechanics of the human mouth led dr wright to study the theories behind the development of the invisible braces technique of teeth straightening  known today around the world as the invisalign® method he has attended multiple classes with two senior invisalign instructors  and is one of the select dentists in the country trained and certified by the invisalign corporation to treat patients using this unique orthodontic system after practicing in the chicago area for 15 years  dr wright  along with his wife debby  decided to open four seasons dental spa in las vegas  nevada their hope was to create the best  most relaxing  biological dental experience in the world for their patients they are committed to pioneering the paradigm shift from fear of going to the dentist  to a relaxing  spa-like experience to which patients look forward dr wright feels strongly that if parents enjoy and look forward to their visits to four seasons dental spa  their children will look forward to the time when they  too  can go to the dental spa dr wright is a conservative biological dentist  and believes in using the least invasive non-surgical approach first  which is traditional scaling and root planing (deep cleaning) when periodontal disease is present  and periodontal pockets measure in excess of 4 mm  the traditional practice is to remove the plaque  calculus and tartar debris from the teeth and provide oral hygiene instruction in addition to this  he treats periodontal disease with a state-of-the art laser to avoid gum surgery for most periodontal disease combining state of the art technology with a conservative biological dental approach  laser energy is applied to inactivate periodontal disease if the disease has advanced and osseous (gum) surgery is necessary  four season's patients are able to have their gum surgery at four seasons dental spa under the expert care of a board certified periodontist  having achieved the level of diplomate today's advanced surgical procedures can cure defects  thereby reducing the patient's susceptibility to periodontal disease in addition to the iaomt  dr wright is also a member of the international academy of

james wright became a dentist because he wanted to help people look and feel their best his philosophy is to treat every patient with respect  kindness and dignity patients say his caring chair-side manner makes them feel comfortable and relaxed dr wright is a perfectionist known for his beautiful cosmetic dentistry  and carefully chooses a restoration color that matches each patient’s tooth color so closely that the tooth looks new again he is also a mercury-free  biological (holistic) dentist who practices the safe removal of mercury fillings the guiding philosophies of biological dentistry are: 1 first do no harm (hippocrates) 2 the health of the mouth and the body are connected by seeking out and working to understand the root cause of illness  the biological practitioner helps the patient achieve health stability and wellness  as well as reduce the need for avoidable and costly treatment? dr wright is a long time accredited member of the international association of oral & medicine toxicology (iaomt) and the international academy of biological dentistry & medicine (iabdm) he uses their recommended mercury removal methods for biological dentists to protect patients from inhaling mercury vapors (hg) or coming in contact with any mercury particulate during the mercury removal process dr wright uses mercury air filtration in his office for additional protection against toxic mercury vapors after using the correct biological dental protocol to remove the decayed tooth material  he restores the tooth with the least toxic  most biologically compatible material available today dr wright put himself through college at illinois benedictine and northeastern university by working full-time while attending classes full-time he then went on to study dentistry and receive a doctorate of dental surgery (dds) from the highly acclaimed marquette university in milwaukee  wisconsin  graduating top in his class with hundreds of hours of extra training  dr wright is always updating his knowledge base by attending classes and learning the latest dental advancements and technology dr wright has also studied at the prestigious dawson center for advanced dental study in st petersburg  florida the dawson center provides excellent post-graduate training in a laboratory-style environment it was at the dawson center that he learned how to properly custom fabricate and fit occlusal appliances  known as night guards these appliances give patients relief from temporomandibular joint syndrome (tmj) or temporomandibular disorder (tmd) tmj and tmd are the most common causes of facial pain other than a toothache dr wright has studied advanced techniques in bite equilibration” this allows patients to function better  preserve their teeth and sometimes eliminate their pain after more than 13 years in his own private practice in chicago  dr wright took additional advanced training for one year with master dentist dr paul saniuk  whose work  skills and ethics he had admired for years dr saniuk is one of the most knowledgeable doctors in the country on full mouth reconstruction  equilibration and various other dental treatment techniques this was a special opportunity for dr wright to learn advanced clinical skills in a one-to-one setting while treating patients with dr saniuk upon completion of this one year of advanced training  dr saniuk remarked  “i marvel that dr wright is such a natural  and how quickly and completely he mastered these techniques he is a true artist” an avid interest in the mechanics of the human mouth led dr wright to study the theories behind the development of the invisible braces technique of teeth straightening  known today around the world as the invisalign® method he has attended multiple classes with two senior invisalign instructors  and is one of the select dentists in the country trained and certified by the invisalign corporation to treat patients using this unique orthodontic system after practicing in the chicago area for 15 years  dr wright  along with his wife debby  decided to open four seasons dental spa in las vegas  nevada their hope was to create the best  most relaxing  biological dental experience in the world for their patients they are committed to pioneering the paradigm shift from fear of going to the dentist  to a relaxing  spa-like experience to which patients look forward dr wright feels strongly that if parents enjoy and look forward to their visits to four seasons dental spa  their children will look forward to the time when they  too  can go to the dental spa dr wright is a conservative biological dentist  and believes in using the least invasive non-surgical approach first  which is traditional scaling and root planing (deep cleaning) when periodontal disease is present  and periodontal pockets measure in excess of 4 mm  the traditional practice is to remove the plaque  calculus and tartar debris from the teeth and provide oral hygiene instruction in addition to this  he treats periodontal disease with a state-of-the art laser to avoid gum surgery for most periodontal disease combining state of the art technology with a conservative biological dental approach  laser energy is applied to inactivate periodontal disease if the disease has advanced and osseous (gum) surgery is necessary  four season's patients are able to have their gum surgery at four seasons dental spa under the expert care of a board certified periodontist  having achieved the level of diplomate today's advanced surgical procedures can cure defects  thereby reducing the patient's susceptibility to periodontal disease in addition to the iaomt  dr wright is also a member of the international academy of biological

techniques this was a special opportunity for dr wright to learn advanced clinical skills in a one-to-one setting while treating patients with dr saniuk upon completion of this one year of advanced training  dr saniuk remarked  “i marvel that dr wright is such a natural  and how quickly and completely he mastered these techniques he is a true artist” an avid interest in the mechanics of the human mouth led dr wright to study the theories behind the development of the invisible braces technique of teeth straightening  known today around the world as the invisalign® method he has attended multiple classes with two senior invisalign instructors  and is one of the select dentists in the country trained and certified by the invisalign corporation to treat patients using this unique orthodontic system after practicing in the chicago area for 15 years  dr wright  along with his wife debby  decided to open four seasons dental spa in las vegas  nevada their hope was to create the best  most relaxing  biological dental experience in the world for their patients they are committed to pioneering the paradigm shift from fear of going to the dentist  to a relaxing  spa-like experience to which patients look forward dr wright feels strongly that if parents enjoy and look forward to their visits to four seasons dental spa  their children will look forward to the time when they  too  can go to the dental spa dr wright is a conservative biological dentist  and believes in using the least invasive non-surgical approach first  which is traditional scaling and root planing (deep cleaning) when periodontal disease is present  and periodontal pockets measure in excess of 4 mm  the traditional practice is to remove the plaque  calculus and tartar debris from the teeth and provide oral hygiene instruction in addition to this  he treats periodontal disease with a state-of-the art laser to avoid gum surgery for most periodontal disease combining state of the art technology with a conservative biological dental approach  laser energy is applied to inactivate periodontal disease if the disease has advanced and osseous (gum) surgery is necessary  four season's patients are able to have their gum surgery at four seasons dental spa under the expert care of a board certified periodontist  having achieved the level of diplomate today's advanced surgical procedures can cure defects  thereby reducing the patient's susceptibility to periodontal disease in addition to the iaomt  dr wright is also a member of the international academy of biological dentistry and medicine  holistic dental association  academy of laser dentistry  american dental association  nevada dental society  southwest nevada dental association and academy of general

the the recovery time for breast augmentation surgery depends upon three factors first  it depends upon the tendency of the individual patient when a patient tells me i always have a fast recovery after surgery  he/she is usually right! second  it is related to the type of surgery to be performed repeat breast surgeries require me tissue manipulation  and lift surgeries (mastopexy) require much more tissue disruption these relate to longer recoveries third  the recovery time correlates with insertion point a single small belly button incision requires the least recovery time  and incision into the nipple/areola area require the most time fourth  you will see higher recovery times with the implants placed under-the-muscle vs on-top-of-the-muscle fifth  the most critical determinant is the choice of anesthesia the use of local (tumescent) anesthesia can reduce recovery time by more than 50% all in all  recovery time will vary from 3 days to 3 weeks depending on a combination of the factors above gregory laurence md wwwthebreastaugmentationdoctorcom,592323,0,371252,11208176,14,university of tennessee college of medicine baylor university,29years,[11841812],"45,397",[u'breast implant removal'  u'breast augmentation'  u'wrinkle'  u'surgery'  u'female health'  u'revision surgery'  u'veins'  u'varicose veins'  u'plastic and cosmetic surgery'  u'healthy pregnancy'  u'birth defects'  u'child health'  u'divalproex'  u'liposuction'  u'scars'  u'breast carcinoma'],although his interests since 1998 have been with innovative office surgery  he has also enjoyed performing major surgery at all private hospital systems in memphis  tn he enjoys teaching staff and working with other board certified physicians to bring the latest in technology to his patients dr laurence was raised near houston  texas he graduated baylor university and the university of texas at houston medical school before he trained in surgery  he trained in one of the country's finest family medicine residency programs  where upon he became board certified later his surgical training was developed more as part of a fellowship in surgical women’s health his advancement as a cosmetic surgeon began in 1996 when he began offering innovative surgical procedures not widely available despite the issues of the early nineties surrounding silicone gel implants  breast augmentation has now rebounded and become one of the most popular cosmetic surgery procedures performed in the united states with the explosion of cosmetic surgery on television and on the internet  there has also been an explosion of information as women research breast enhancement and try to determine the best approach to achieve their goals  they are often inundated by too much information dr laurence performed the first memphis breast augmentation in the subfascial pocket  a placement that has distinct advantages over other placements the subfascial sling allows for full implant coverage and holds the implant closer to the midline  which gives a more natural cleavage appearance this tends to be the surgery of choice for women who have well developed pectoralis muscles or who workout their upper body a great deal because the breast implant will not move along with the muscle  even with the formation of a mild capsule this technique combines the advantages of the subglandular approach with the advantages of the subpectoral or the submuscular technique this placement also gives a lift appearance to the medium-sized droopy (ptotic) breast which does not require the aggressive scarring of the lift (mastopexy) procedure he was the first area physician to offer a superior type of anesthesia called tumescent this technique is the safest anesthesia known and speeds recovery time to 1/2 to 1/4th of the normal recovery for major cosmetic surgeries dr laurence was also the first physician in memphis to perform the belly button (transumbilical breast augmentation - tuba) with the tumescent (local) anesthesia technique to form the ttuba although the ttuba (tumescent tuba) remains his cornerstone procedure  dr laurence insists on evaluating each patient as an individual  and making a recommendation that makes sense for the individual too often in this area of cosmetic surgery  many surgeons maintain that one size fits all mentality which is the opposite of dr laurence's assertion,[u'dr laurence is an amazing doctor! #nationaldoctorsday2015 #virtualflower1'  u'dr laurence is an amazing doctor! #nationaldoctorsday2015 #virtualflower1'],,vascular surgery,16,[u'female health'  u'cosmetic breast surgery'  u'breast augmentation'],what should i expect for breast augmentation recovery time? how long does it typically take to recover from a breast augmentation? how long is it likely i would be unable to go to work if i am on my feet all day and how long do people tend to be sore?

manner makes them feel comfortable and relaxed dr wright is a perfectionist known for his beautiful cosmetic dentistry  and carefully chooses a restoration color that matches each patient’s tooth color so closely that the tooth looks new again he is also a mercury-free  biological (holistic) dentist who practices the safe removal of mercury fillings the guiding philosophies of biological dentistry are: 1 first do no harm (hippocrates) 2 the health of the mouth and the body are connected by seeking out and working to understand the root cause of illness  the biological practitioner helps the patient achieve health stability and wellness  as well as reduce the need for avoidable and costly treatment? dr wright is a long time accredited member of the international association of oral & medicine toxicology (iaomt) and the international academy of biological dentistry & medicine (iabdm) he uses their recommended mercury removal methods for biological dentists to protect patients from inhaling mercury vapors (hg) or coming in contact with any mercury particulate during the mercury removal process dr wright uses mercury air filtration in his office for additional protection against toxic mercury vapors after using the correct biological dental protocol to remove the decayed tooth material  he restores the tooth with the least toxic  most biologically compatible material available today dr wright put himself through college at illinois benedictine and northeastern university by working full-time while attending classes full-time he then went on to study dentistry and receive a doctorate of dental surgery (dds) from the highly acclaimed marquette university in milwaukee  wisconsin  graduating top in his class with hundreds of hours of extra training  dr wright is always updating his knowledge base by attending classes and learning the latest dental advancements and technology dr wright has also studied at the prestigious dawson center for advanced dental study in st petersburg  florida the dawson center provides excellent post-graduate training in a laboratory-style environment it was at the dawson center that he learned how to properly custom fabricate and fit occlusal appliances  known as night guards these appliances give patients relief from temporomandibular joint syndrome (tmj) or temporomandibular disorder (tmd) tmj and tmd are the most common causes of facial pain other than a toothache dr wright has studied advanced techniques in bite equilibration” this allows patients to function better  preserve their teeth and sometimes eliminate their pain after more than 13 years in his own private practice in chicago  dr wright took additional advanced training for one year with master dentist dr paul saniuk  whose work  skills and ethics he had admired for years dr saniuk is one of the most knowledgeable doctors in the country on full mouth reconstruction  equilibration and various other dental treatment techniques this was a special opportunity for dr wright to learn advanced clinical skills in a one-to-one setting while treating patients with dr saniuk upon completion of this one year of advanced training  dr saniuk remarked  “i marvel that dr wright is such a natural  and how quickly and completely he mastered these techniques he is a true artist” an avid interest in the mechanics of the human mouth led dr wright to study the theories behind the development of the invisible braces technique of teeth straightening  known today around the world as the invisalign® method he has attended multiple classes with two senior invisalign instructors  and is one of the select dentists in the country trained and certified by the invisalign corporation to treat patients using this unique orthodontic system after practicing in the chicago area for 15 years  dr wright  along with his wife debby  decided to open four seasons dental spa in las vegas  nevada their hope was to create the best  most relaxing  biological dental experience in the world for their patients they are committed to pioneering the paradigm shift from fear of going to the dentist  to a relaxing  spa-like experience to which patients look forward dr wright feels strongly that if parents enjoy and look forward to their visits to four seasons dental spa  their children will look forward to the time when they  too  can go to the dental spa dr wright is a conservative biological dentist  and believes in using the least invasive non-surgical approach first  which is traditional scaling and root planing (deep cleaning) when periodontal disease is present  and periodontal pockets measure in excess of 4 mm  the traditional practice is to remove the plaque  calculus and tartar debris from the teeth and provide oral hygiene instruction in addition to this  he treats periodontal disease with a state-of-the art laser to avoid gum surgery for most periodontal disease combining state of the art
