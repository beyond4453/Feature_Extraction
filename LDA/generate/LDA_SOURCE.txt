had to redo mammogram because breast tissue wasnt compressed  looked suspicious caused great anxiety why not done properly 1st time yes it is possible initial mammogram may have not had enough compression an area or the overlapping structures may have caused a summation shadow the original mammogram may have been performed well but the radiologist saw something and wanted extra views extra spot views provide focal compression over the area of concern and spread out the tissues more to make sure there is nothing of concern in that area

i have many ms symptoms and i am scheduled for a brain and neck mri  what if they show nothing  will there be no diagnosis ms tests pending some ms symptoms help make the diagnosis and sometimes mri testing is needed when that fails sometimes spinal tap testing is helpful for now it makes sense to get your test results before a plan is agreed on to see in general how the ms diagnosis is made try this tool: http:  wwwneurocurocom howdoyouknowifyouhavems
i have many ms symptoms and i am scheduled for a brain and neck mri  what if they show nothing  will there be no diagnosis multiple dx not knowing exactly what you mean by ms symptoms clouds the issue but does not mean there is no diagnosis pending at your age a number of neurological deficits some of minor importance and some more significant can mimic ms but i would wait for the mri before despairing over lack of diagnosis
i have many ms symptoms and i am scheduled for a brain and neck mri  what if they show nothing  will there be no diagnosis variable at age 72 yrs i would doubt the answer for your symptoms is ms ms symptoms could be very nonspecific and due to different disease process some doctors do not seem as open or definitive as others and may communicate minimally if yours is similar you may need a second opinion you see there is always an answer to symptoms just need to find it

i had a ct 5 days ago and 3 xrays today pelvis abdomen flank pain all normal dr wants another ct with and w o contrast done is this a cancer risk no not really medical use of xrays causes minimal radiation exposure so it is considered safe so you should not worry about cancer at the present level of ct scanning
i had a ct 5 days ago and 3 xrays today pelvis abdomen flank pain all normal dr wants another ct with and w o contrast done is this a cancer risk low risk it does seem to be excessive the risks should be counted through out your lifetime if you didnt have any other studies requiring xray radiation youd be fine but this seems really excessive when ultrasound or mri can be used to get more information try suggesting these non ionizing radiation studies
i had a ct 5 days ago and 3 xrays today pelvis abdomen flank pain all normal dr wants another ct with and w o contrast done is this a cancer risk yes but the reason the doc wants the xrays may well out weigh the risk of having the test done i believe the risk is worth the knowledge of what is going on you may well enough information to prevent further or disease that is present
my two year monitor for lung nodule be over in fall 2014 will i need monitor after that with ct scan of chest i am concerned about the radiation contact us in 2014 we could not plan anything further till you have your ct in fall of 2014 if it shows no change in your lung nodule you do not need to follow with further ct scans necessarily a plane chest xray once yearly or every 6 months may suffice and it will have much lower doses of radiation to your body so it is safer too
my two year monitor for lung nodule be over in fall 2014 will i need monitor after that with ct scan of chest i am concerned about the radiation many factors need to be looked at age smoking family and previous cancer history also characteristics of the mass radiation does have a risk if your doctor agrees and you are low risk then perhaps plain cxr is adequate yearly if there is no change and features are low risk discuss it in detail with your doctor but dont ignore it stable nodules can and do change
my two year monitor for lung nodule be over in fall 2014 will i need monitor after that with ct scan of chest i am concerned about the radiation not recommended if you have stable nodule for 2 years and you have no symptoms plus non smoker then no need to repeat ct
pain in the shoulder arm and scapula as well as pain in the back while bendng the neck forward ~3 minutes of chest ct scan normal 2 months ago smoker worried about pancoast tumor is a repeat chest ct scan necessary you need a good doct a good doctor should be able to investigate your problems with the relevant tests you are thinking about rare cancers if you were a heavy smoker and over 50 then you might think about pancoast tumor but it is unlikely in your case the pain can come from chest bones or spinal canal spinal cord a good physical exam and closer look at all structures in the area of the pain should helpdiagnosis

are older antidepressants better for depression in parkinsons disease not really although still used there is no evidence that they are any better than newer antidepressants in treating depression in parkinsons patients in fact they may actually be more risky since the older antidepressants have many more side effects they interact with more receptor sites in the brain than newer antidepressants raising the chances of serious unwanted side effects
are older antidepressants better for depression in parkinsons disease nortriptyline nortriptyline which is a tricyclic antidepressant has been shown to be helpful for depression in those with parkinsons disease also paroxetine has some evidence for treating depression in parkinsons in general antidepressants that work on norepinephrine and dopamine seem to help more antidepressants that affect serotonin can worsen movement symptoms common in pd such as restless legs
are older antidepressants better for depression in parkinsons disease ect i cant say for sure but electroconvulsive therapy ect is the most powerful tool we have to treat severe depression and it can have positive although transient effects on parkinsonianism reducing symptoms in the short term

would signs of breast cancer show up on a regular chest ex ray or would that only show up on a mammogram mammogram although the breast shadows do show up on a regular chest xray cancer in the breasts cannot be diagnosed on a chest xray mammogram is the main diagnostic tool for breast cancer complimented by breast ultrasound and mri in specific situations

would signs of breast cancer show up on a regular chest ex ray or would that only show up on a mammogram no on xray mammograms are the best diagnostic test to diagnose breast cancer coupled with good breast exams and ultrasounds  these are the mainstays of diagnosis chest x rays can show advanced cancer if there is metastasis spread to the lungs  but typically regular xrays are not sensitive or specific enough
would signs of breast cancer show up on a regular chest ex ray or would that only show up on a mammogram mammogram if breast cancer is very advanced and there are lung masses stage iv spread by the blood stream then it could be seen on a chest xray mammography is of course dedicated to finding breast cancer early and is the appropriate test in a person who is not quite ill an abnormal chest xray likely has another explanation

does dental bonding work for filling in cavities ive read that you can have a dental bonding procedure performed to fill in cavities is this true are there any advantages to it over regular fillings i i assume that you are referring to amalgam or silver fillings as regular fillings and dental bonding as bonded composite fillings either one replaces the lost tooth structure destroyed by cavities amalgam fillings look unesthetic conduct hot and cold more to the nerves of the teeth and therefore often cause more sensitivity when drinking or eating very hot and cold liquids or food bonded composite fillings sometimes wear more than amalgam fillings but look more esthetic often appear invisible and actually bond to tooth structure thereby making them stronger rather than weaker once filled generally speaking i would much prefer to have bonded composite fillings in my own mouth as there are many more advantages to them you and other readers should be aware that they are usally more costly and many insurance companies will not pay for the additional cost on posterior or back teeth which is unfortunate
does dental bonding work for filling in cavities ive read that you can have a dental bonding procedure performed to fill in cavities is this true are there any advantages to it over regular fillings bonded composite is a far better filling material than amalgam mercury fillings for several reasons 1 amalgam expands and contracts at a far greater rate than tooth structure when having hot or cold foods this difference causes chipped cracked teeth and recurrent decay 2 greater tooth reduction needed when placing amalgam retention grooves cut into healthy tooth= weaker tooth 3 toxic mercury in amalgam

does dental bonding work for filling in cavities ive read that you can have a dental bonding procedure performed to fill in cavities is this true are there any advantages to it over regular fillings dental dental bonding in lay terms is just a white filling compared to a silver filling most people would like to have white fillings because it matches the tooth and it looks much more natural when you smile then a bunch of silver in your mouth the disadvantages to you would be purely out of pocket since white fillings or bonds are more expensive than silver fillings some insurances cover only the teeth that are in the front and feel you can use the cheaper silver ones in the back since they can not be seen in my mouth i would only have white bonded fillings because it just looks more natural

old root canal without crown now has cavity should i opt for crown lengthening with filling and crown or pull it and get an implant depends it does depend on the strength of the tooth generally if a tooth has a root canal it had multiple fillings before this possibly a fracture it is compromised already even after all the time and financial commitments of restoring the chances of that tooth surviving 3 5 years is not great then you are back to getting an implant i try not to pay for things twice but it is a decision between you
