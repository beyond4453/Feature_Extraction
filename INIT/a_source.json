While diabetes can give peripheral neuropathy typically the tingling associated with diabetic neuropathy will affect both hands equally as well as the feet. However with diabetes or any other systemic problem that can affect nerves and circulation, the presence of the underlying disorder can worsen the symptoms of carpal tunnel when it gets worse. This also means that diabetes sometimes prevents the pain form occurring early on and when it does occur may feel worse suddenly. Nonetheless the reason carpal tunnel seems to be worse at night when sleeping is several fold. 1, the pressure on the nerve is increased by the increased tissue pressure form lying down, the fluid that sits outside the cells redistributes itself to the face and upper extremity when someone lies down ( its why feet are swollen at the end of the day and the face feels puffy and fingers stiff in the am). This extra fluid increases the pressure on the nerve. A second thing that often occurs when one sleeps unsplnted is that the wrists flexed or extended, also putting more pressure on the nerve. The pressure builds, the fingers go numb, pain follows and finally the pain build enough to awaken the sufferer. To start, a simple wrist splint may suffice to help with the night time symptoms. Not too tight as that can cause pressure on the nerve too defeating the purpose.

This spot bulges out from the artery almost like the finger of a rubber glove. Often, the size of aneurysms is stated in terms of their length, although other dimensions are important in determining risk and approach. An aneurysm is on the small side if it is less than 7 mm or so in length (around a quarter-inch). An aneurysm is on the big side if it is above 10 mm or so. Most doctors agree that the longer an aneurysm is, the more likely it is to burst (although this may not actually be the case). When an aneurysm bursts, it produces a kind of stroke called a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which can have a very bad outcome (as in death, or worse). Aneurysms can sometimes also cause pressure on nearby brain or nerves, and can sometimes leak a bit without bursting. Before brain imaging was easy and common, aneurysms were usually only found after the patient had developed symptoms. These days, it is probably true that most aneurysms are not expected but instead are found when the brain is imaged for unrelated problems. There are different ways to surgically treat an aneurysm. These include clipping (in which a spring-metal clip is placed across the neck of the aneurysm -- it requires opening the skull) and coiling (in which something that looks a lot like a lightbulb filament is placed into the aneurysm from inside the artery). Sometimes surgery is not offered, and medical treatment, including monitoring and control of risk factors is chosen. The risks and benefits of these different approaches depends on a huge number of factors, and the best way to get an individual assessment of these risks and benefits is through discussion with a doctor, probably the surgeon or other interventionalist.", "answer_voted": "1"},

Without having met you i can only guess as to what is going on, but i would consider asking your dentist for a referral to see an endodontist for a consultation. Endodontists specialize in the nerve of the teeth and from what you're describing it sounds as though your nerve is irritated, dying or is already dead. Sometimes after having dental work done (such as getting a crown placed) the nerve can be irritated and just needs time to relax and go back to normal. Sometimes though, the nerve can be permantently damaged to no fault of the dentist (it can just happen sometimes) and will need a root canal. If your gums are inflammed, then there's probably truth to what your dentist said about getting the gums cut back as the inflammation will usually not resolve itself and will only lead to more destruction in the mouth unless it's corrected by the minor surgery.
